SANGER", "title": "Korea Talks Begin as Kim Jong-un Crosses to South's Side of DMZ", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/world/asia/korea-kim-moon-summit.html", "contents": "SEOUL, South Korea -- on Friday became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korean-controlled territory, starting a historic summit meeting with the South's president that will test Mr. Kim's willingness to bargain away his nuclear weapons.Mr. Kim's crossing of the line at the heart of the world's most heavily armed border zone, a prospect that seemed unthinkable just a few months ago, was broadcast live in South Korea, where a riveted nation sought to discern the intentions of the North's 34-year-old leader.For South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, who has placed himself at the center of diplomacy to end the nuclear standoff with the North, the meeting presents a formidable task: finding a middle ground between a to the North and an impulsive ally in the United States.The historic encounter at the Peace House, a conference building on the South Korean side of , could set the tone for an even more critical meeting planned between Mr. Kim and President Trump.On Friday morning, Mr. Kim emerged from a North Korean administrative building inside Panmunjom and walked toward the border line, where Mr. Moon was waiting. The two leaders smiled and shook hands across a concrete slab that marks the border bisecting Panmunjom.Then, Mr. Kim stepped across the border.After the two leaders posed for photos, they crossed briefly into the North's territory at Mr. Kim's suggestion, another highly symbolic moment. They then stepped back into South Korean territory, holding hands, and walked down a red carpet to inspect a South Korean military honor guard and enter the Peace House.\"I came here to put an end to the history of confrontation,\" Mr. Kim was quoted as saying during the meeting, according to Mr. Moon's spokesman, Yoon Young-chan. Mr. Moon suggested they hold more meetings, and Mr. Kim said he would visit South Korea's presidential Blue House \"if the president invites me.\"While Mr. Moon's meeting with Mr. Kim on Friday -- their first face-to-face talk -- is rich with symbolism, Mr. Kim is not expected to capitulate on Mr. Trump's key demand: total and immediate nuclear disarmament.Mr. Moon's other challenge, with Mr. Trump, turns on how best to deal with North Korea and its leader -- who is expected to meet with Mr. Trump in the next few months.The South Korean president favors an \"action for action\" strategy in which the North takes steps to dismantle its nuclear arsenal and is rewarded for each move with economic benefits and security guarantees. South Korean officials said that the entire process could take about two years.Mr. Trump's national security team, by contrast, has insisted that North Korea must scrap its weapons programs before any relief from the sanctions that isolate the nation can be granted. And they say that \"substantial dismantlement\" should be completed much more quickly, perhaps in six months.Mr. Moon sees himself less as a negotiator with Mr. Kim and more as a mediator shuttling between two men who believe that keeping others guessing gives them an edge: a volatile American president with no experience in nuclear negotiations, and a with no experience on a global stage.\"What we can do is to try to help the North and the United States reach an agreement, helping them narrow their differences and seeking and presenting practical ideas both sides can accept,\" Mr. Moon said recently, adding that he may have only one shot to get it right. \"This is an opportunity that will not come again.\". No nation that has openly tested a nuclear device has ever surrendered its arsenal, and North Korea has conducted six underground explosions, each more powerful than the last, and has test-fired .But Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have both already about what is possible. If they meet in June -- most likely in Singapore, according to American and South Korean officials -- it would be the between the leaders of the two nations, as well as a chance to test the argument that making progress with North Korea in the nuclear standoff requires starting at the top.The meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon is the third summit meeting between leaders of the two countries, but the first in which denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula tops the agenda.\"I hope we can have open-minded talks on issues of concern and produce good results, not the kind of results we saw in the past that were not implemented and made us start from scratch again,\" Mr. Kim said as the talks began on Friday. For his part, Mr. Moon said he hoped that the two leaders could engage in \"broad-minded\" discussions and produce \"a big gift\" for those yearning for peace on the Korean Peninsula.Mr. Moon hopes to emerge from Friday's summit meeting with a formal but vague denuclearization commitment from Mr. Kim and perhaps a path to negotiating a peace treaty or a plan to reduce military tensions. Some have suggested a pullback of troops from the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South is possible.But Mr. Moon has acknowledged that there is a limit to what the two Koreas can agree on without American involvement. \"Peace on the Korean Peninsula cannot be achieved by agreements between South and North Korea alone,\" he said last month. \"It has to have American endorsement.\"One measure of success will be whether Mr. Moon can persuade Mr. Kim to set a timetable for denuclearization in his talks with Mr. Trump.\"Confirming a willingness to denuclearize is not enough. What matters is an agreement on by when the North will denuclearize,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean think tank.Some who have tried and failed to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program worry that Mr. Trump, having threatened the North with nuclear annihilation, has now swung too far to the other side and may be too eager to make a deal. Having derided Mr. Kim previously as \"Little Rocket Man,\" Mr. Trump described the North Korean leader as \"very honorable\" this week.\"I find it impossible to believe that Kim is prepared to give up what his father and his grandfather bequeathed to him,\" said Gary Samore, a veteran of negotiations with North Korea as the top arms control aide in the Clinton and Obama administrations, speaking at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.But he added that Mr. Kim \"may now calculate he has enough of a nuclear arsenal\" -- and so can afford to put more on the table than in the past.One possibility that causes consternation in the region is that Mr. Trump will settle for dismantling North Korea's small fleet of intercontinental ballistic missiles, eliminating its ability to strike the United States -- but leaving South Korea and Japan vulnerable. \"It would be the 'America First' way,\" Mr. Samore said, referring to Mr. Trump's campaign slogan.If skepticism is rampant in Washington, the Moon administration is somewhat more optimistic. To South Korean policymakers, Mr. Kim's recent decisions suggest that he is willing to , which the young leader may see as necessary to preserving his rule for decades. They also argue that Mr. Trump's threats of military action have proved more effective at changing Mr. Kim's calculations than anticipated.South Korean officials say they have spent far more time and energy coordinating with the Trump administration before the Friday summit meeting than with the North Koreans, an effort complicated by the White House shake-up that included the as national security adviser and the .The focus on Washington also reflects concern about General McMaster's successor, , who joined the administration after to destroy North Korea's nuclear arsenal, ridiculing South Korean leaders as \"putty in North Korea's hands,\" and calling North Koreans \"the biggest con men in the world.\"Mr. Moon's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, described Mr. Bolton as an \"honest broker\" after their first meeting this month, and he traveled again to Washington this week for further discussions with Mr. Bolton.One mystery is what, if any, progress was made in , the North's capital, this month between Mr. Kim and Mike Pompeo, the former C.I.A. director who was confirmed Thursday as secretary of state. Mr. Trump said Thursday that Mr. Pompeo was not scheduled to see Mr. Kim but had \"a great meeting\" that lasted more than an hour.Though Mr. Moon and Mr. Trump have outlined different approaches to negotiating with North Korea, they agree on the need to avoid the pitfalls that doomed previous rounds of talks.One area of consensus is an attempt to more clearly establish the talks' desired outcome from the outset, giving all parties greater incentive to move forward. Previous negotiations were open-ended, without specific goals that everyone agreed on.South Korea and the United States also want to push the North to accept a timetable that would move quickly from -- which it announced last week -- to the dismantlement of its nuclear program. Some in the Trump administration have argued for completion in six months, but that may be an opening negotiating position given the challenges involved.Mr. Bolton has occasionally cited the example of Libya, which shipped most of its nuclear equipment to an American weapons lab in Tennessee over the course of several weeks in late 2003. But much of that equipment was still in crates; there was little to dismantle.Iran took a bit more than six months to take apart much of its program and ship 97 percent of its nuclear material from the country. But, like Libya, it had not yet built nuclear weapons.North Korea is believed to have 20 to 60 such weapons -- American intelligence agencies cannot agree on the number -- in addition to a vast infrastructure of fuel production and weapons manufacturing facilities, much of it hidden in the mountains or underground. Mr. Samore argued that the North should be asked to hand over an inventory that the United States and its allies could compare with intelligence reports and seek to verify. That process would offer a first sign of whether Mr. Kim is coming clean, but could take years to complete.\"I do not know of any way of unilaterally verifying an agreement whereby North Korea gives up its nuclear arsenal,\" said William J. Perry, a former defense secretary. \"We do not know how many nuclear weapons North Korea has operational or under construction. We do not know where all of their nuclear facilities are located.\"Mr. Moon's aides have argued that it is unrealistic to expect North Korea to simply surrender its arsenal without an \"action for action\" process that offers immediate benefits and builds trust. Early steps by the North could include the dismantlement of missile production facilities and allowing the return of international inspectors to nuclear sites, while the United States could begin normalizing diplomatic relations and easing some sanctions, like those that primarily affect North Korea's population rather than officials, analysts say.Mr. Kim has also endorsed \"phased, synchronized steps\" toward denuclearization.But White House officials have repeatedly rejected the incremental approach, saying past administrations have tried it without success.There have been hints of friction between the Trump administration and Mr. Moon's team over the issue, with local news outlets in South Korea reporting that Mr. Bolton had pressed Seoul \"not to move too far ahead\" in its talks with Mr. Kim. A senior aide to Mr. Moon firmly denied the reports."},

For Mr. Moon, a dark business suit was paired with a light blue tie that echoed the hue used in the Korean Unification Flag, which the countries use when competing together as single team at international sporting events.Mr. Kim wore an austere black Mao-style suit, a message to his citizens that despite being in enemy territory he was still committed to the ideals -- and dress -- of his grandfather Kim Il-sung, North Korea's founder, who ordered the 1950 invasion of the South that started the Korean War.Once on the South side of the Demilitarized Zone, the stretch of land that makes up the border and in which the summit meeting took place, Mr. Kim inspected a military honor guard. Though the DMZ is heavily fortified and security was tightened for the visit, the honor guard's soldiers carried spears and swords, instead of rifles. They were dressed in 19th-century costumes, worn at a time when Korea was a unified empire.Even the decor inside Peace House, the building in which the meeting took place, was chosen for its political optics. In the run-up to the talks, workers hung paintings of Mount Kumgang, which straddles the border and is an important symbol to Koreans in both countries.The table and chairs inside the meeting room were also carefully designed with a pattern evoking two bridges coming together.At the table was Mr. Kim's sister, , the only woman in the delegation. Ms. Kim's stature has risen since she represented the North's government at this year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. That visit was widely seen as an opening gambit toward a detente, and Ms. Kim was widely credited with softening her country's image.At Peace House, Mr. Kim signed a guest book, leaving a message guaranteed to be photographed, tweeted and deconstructed by political analysts.\"A new history starts now,\" he wrote. \"An age of peace, from the starting point of history.\""},

Steele, asked that Mr. Cosby's $1 million bail be revoked, suggesting he had been convicted of a serious crime, owned a plane and could flee, prompting an angry outburst from Mr. Cosby, who shouted, \"He doesn't have a plane, you asshole.\"[]\"Enough of that,\" Judge Steven T. O'Neill said. He did not view Mr. Cosby as a flight risk, he said, adding that he could be released on bail but that he would have to remain in his nearby home. The judge did not set a date to sentence Mr. Cosby on the three counts, all felonies and each punishable by up to 10 years in state prison.The National Organization for Women called the verdict a \"notice to sexual predators everywhere.\" Rose McGowan, one of the women who has accused Harvey Weinstein of assault, tweeted a thank you to the judge and jury and to \"society for waking up.\" Gloria Allred, the lawyer who represented many of Mr. Cosby's accusers, hailed the decision as an important breakthrough.\"After all is said and done, women were finally believed,\" she said outside the courtroom.The impression of change was evident within the trial itself when the defense attacked the credibility of five women who had testified that they, too, believed Mr. Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted them. Kathleen Bliss, one of Mr. Cosby's lawyers, called one of the women a failed starlet who slept around. She branded another a publicity seeker.The remarks inflamed Kristen Gibbons Feden, a prosecutor on the case. She called the attacks filthy and shameful and the sort of criticism that had long kept sexual assault victims from coming forward. Ms. Feden's colleague, M. Stewart Ryan, described Ms. Bliss's approach as \"the last vestiges of a tactic not to get to the truth, but to damage character and reputation.\"Their boss, Kevin R. Steele, the Montgomery County district attorney, referenced the broader significance of the case when he thanked Ms. Constand for taking part in not one, but two trials. \"She has been a major factor in a movement that has gone in the right direction, finally,\" he said.The first trial ended with a hung jury after six days of deliberations last summer. When the jury announced its decision Thursday, Mr. Cosby sat back in his chair and quietly stared down. Several women who have accused him of abuse, and attended the trial each day, briefly cheered. Ms. Constand, who had been quiet throughout, stood up and was hugged by supporters, including her lawyer.[]Mr. Cosby did not comment as he left the courthouse, but his lead lawyer, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., said his client would appeal. \"We are very disappointed by the verdict,\" he said. \"We don't believe Mr. Cosby is guilty of anything.\"In recent years, Mr. Cosby, 80, had admitted to decades of philandering, and to giving quaaludes to women as part of an effort to have sex, smashing the image he had built as a moralizing public figure and the upstanding paterfamilias in the wildly popular 1980s and '90s sitcom \"The Cosby Show.\" He did not testify in his own defense, avoiding a grilling about those admissions, but he and his lawyers have insisted that his encounter with Ms. Constand was part of a consensual affair, not an assault.The verdict now marks the bottom of a fall as precipitous as any in show business history and leaves in limbo a large slice of American popular culture from Mr. Cosby's six-decade career as a comedian and actor. For the last few years, his TV shows, films and recorded stand-up performances, once broadcast staples, have largely been shunned, and with his conviction, they are likely to remain so.At Mr. Cosby's retrial, in the same courthouse and before the same judge, a new defense team argued unsuccessfully that Ms. Constand, now 45, was a desperate \"con artist\" with financial problems who steadily worked her famous but lonely mark for a lucrative payday.The prosecution countered that it was Mr. Cosby who had been a deceiver, hiding behind his amiable image as America's Dad to prey on women that he first incapacitated with intoxicants. During closing arguments Tuesday, Ms. Feden told the jury: \"She is not the con. He is.\"The defense's star witness was a veteran academic adviser at Temple who said Ms. Constand had confided to her in 2004 that she could make money by falsely claiming she had been molested by a prominent person. Mr. Cosby paid Ms. Constand $3.38 million in 2006 as part of the confidential financial settlement of a lawsuit she had brought against him after prosecutors originally declined to bring charges.[]But Ms. Constand said she had never spoken with the adviser, and prosecutors rebutted her characterization as a schemer. Perhaps most damaging to Mr. Cosby, was the testimony from five other women who told jurors they, too, were Cosby victims. The powerful drumbeat of accounts allowed prosecutors to argue that Ms. Constand's assault was part of a signature pattern of predatory behavior.Mr. Cosby's lawyers had tried to block the additional women from testifying, arguing their accounts would be prejudicial. They noted that the scrutiny of sexual assault had heightened, and recently had ensnared a group of high-profile men, but they said it was only Mr. Cosby who was on trial in this instance. \"Mob rule is not due process,\" Ms. Bliss told the jury.When Ms. Constand testified, she took the stand as something of a proxy for the other women, more than 50, who have accused Mr. Cosby of abuses.None of those accusations had resulted in prosecution. In many of the cases, too much time had passed for criminal charges to be considered, so Ms. Constand's case emerged as the only criminal test of Mr. Cosby's guilt.But Mr. Cosby has been sued by several accusers, some of whom said he or his staff defamed them by dismissing their allegations as fabrications.The suits are likely to draw momentum from the guilty verdict.Many of the accusers celebrated the verdict with laughter and tears. Patricia Steuer, 61, who accused Mr. Cosby of drugging and assaulting her in 1978 and 1980, said she and her husband were in a pharmacy at Lake Tahoe when the news arrived by text.\"We just collapsed in each other's arms,\" she said. \"We were just crying.\"Mr. Cosby returned to the suburban mansion where, in the evening, his spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, said Mr. Cosby planned to appeal on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and to also assert that the statute of limitations had expired before charges were filed in December 2015.\"God puts certain situations in your life, not to destroy you but to build you,\" Mr. Wyatt said. \"We build from here.\"The case largely turned on the credibility of , who testified that during a visit in early 2004 to Mr. Cosby's home near Philadelphia, when she was 30 and he was 66, Mr. Cosby gave her pills that left her immobile and drifting in and out of consciousness. He said he had only given her Benadryl.[]\"I was kind of jolted awake and felt Mr. Cosby on the couch beside me, behind me, and my vagina was being penetrated quite forcefully, and I felt my breast being touched,\" Ms. Constand said. \"I was limp, and I could not fight him off.\"In Mr. Cosby's first trial, only one other accuser had been allowed to testify. At the retrial, the five additional witnesses included the former model Janice Dickinson, who told jurors Mr. Cosby had assaulted her in a Lake Tahoe hotel room in 1982, after giving her a pill to help with menstrual cramps. \"Here was America's Dad on top of me,\" she told the courtroom, \"a happily married man with five children, on top of me.\"The defense suggested that Ms. Dickinson had made up the account, pointing to her memoir, which recounted the meeting without mentioning any assault. But Ms. Dickinson's publisher testified that she had shared her account of rape and that it was kept out of the book for legal reasons.Another accuser, Chelan Lasha, said Mr. Cosby invited her to his suite at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1986, when she was 17, to help her with her modeling career. Mr. Cosby, she said, gave her a pill and liquor, and then assaulted her.In court, Ms. Lasha, who was often in tears, called across the courtroom to the entertainer.\"You remember,\" she asked, \"don't you, Mr. Cosby?\"The defense team tried to convince the jurors that Mr. Cosby's main accuser, Ms. Constand, saw him as her escape from financial straits. \"You are going to be asking yourself during this trial, 'What does she want from Bill Cosby?' And you already know the answer: 'Money, money and lots more money,'\" Mr. Mesereau told the jurors as he opened his defense of Mr. Cosby.The defense emphasized inconsistencies in the version of events Ms. Constand had given the police, saying, for example, at one point that the assault had taken place in March 2004, then later changing that to January 2004.Mr. Cosby's lawyers cited her phone records to show she had stayed in touch with him after the encounter and they produced detailed travel itineraries and flight schedules in an effort to show that Mr. Cosby had not stayed at his Philadelphia home during the period in which she said the assault occurred.\"He was lonely and troubled and he made a terrible mistake confiding in her what was going on in his life,\" Mr. Mesereau said.Under cross-examination, Ms. Constand explained the lapses in her accounts as innocent mistakes, and said her contacts with Mr. Cosby after the incident were mostly cursory, the unavoidable result of her job duties.Mr. Steele told the jury that Mr. Cosby took away Ms. Constand's ability to consent with the pills he gave her, and that their later contacts were irrelevant.When Ms. Constand's mother called to confront Mr. Cosby about a year after the incident, the prosecution argued, his apology and his offer to pay for her schooling, therapy and a trip to Florida were evidence he knew he had done something wrong.Mr. Steele, the district attorney, also worked to rebut the defense claims. He said that Mr. Cosby, a member of Temple University's board of directors at the time and the university's most famous alumnus, set his sights on Ms. Constand, an employee in the athletic department who considered him a mentor.\"This case is about trust,\" Mr. Steele had told the jurors. \"This case is about betrayal, and that betrayal leading to a sexual assault of a woman named Andrea Constand.\""},

In the spring of 2017, a jury could not agree on whether Mr. Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand, setting the stage for a retrial.But between that trial and this one came the revelations over Harvey Weinstein and a cascade of other powerful men that invigorated the #MeToo movement. The big question: would it make any difference?It well may have. The jury deliberated not even two days -- compared with six days the first time around -- before finding Mr. Cosby guilty on all counts.There were other key differences: Jurors saw a new defense witness, who testified that Ms. Constand had said it would be easy to use fabricated abuse claims to extort a celebrity.And they saw more evidence of a pattern of predatory behavior that extended beyond Ms. Constand: The judge allowed five of Mr. Cosby's more than 50 accusers to testify, compared with one at the first trial. But some have suggested that the judge's decision was also a response to shifting social views after #MeToo.Jurors, male and female alike, have been notoriously reluctant to convict in sexual misconduct cases, particularly when the accused is significantly more powerful than the victim, or when the victim is poor or a member of a minority group, prosecutors and other jury experts say.Juries tend to focus on two main issues: One, whether they believe the accuser, and two, whether the sexual behavior was consensual.The question of consent gets particular scrutiny when the victim previously knew the accused, which is the case in the majority of sexual assaults. In a series of in England in 2013, many jurors said that acquaintance rapes were \"less clear cut\" and \"more difficult to prove\" than rapes by strangers.Especially in cases that hinge on he-said-she-said evidence, a jury must not only believe the victim, said , a law professor at Northwestern University and former prosecutor, but they must also be able to imagine themselves or someone close to them in her shoes.\"Do we care? Do we think this is serious? Do we think this is worth a conviction?\" she said. as whether or not the victim fought back, whether she has the injuries to prove it, whether she had been drinking or whether she had done anything to signal her consent. If the victim did not physically resist, even if she was fearful or incapacitated, one study showed she was more likely to be . Jurors also doubted victims who did not show emotion on the stand.After the first Cosby trial, a male juror -- quoted anonymously by The Philadelphia Inquirer -- said: \"Let's face it: She went up to his house with a bare midriff and incense and bath salts. What the heck?\"Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman: The voices of some of the world's most famous women accusing Harvey Weinstein, the powerful Hollywood producer, of serial sexual misconduct over a period of decades convinced some people that the women had nothing to gain -- and much to lose -- by lying about Mr. Weinstein, who has denied committing any crime.Their stories, along with those of much less famous women, made it plain how powerful men have been able to get away with such criminal behavior and shed light on the many reasons victims might choose to remain silent, including both explicit and implicit threats to their careers and reputations.The women also gained traction through sheer numbers, with accounts that were precise, detailed and fit a patternBut Melissa M. Gomez, a jury expert and author of the book, \"Jury Trials Outside In,\" said her research showed that the #MeToo movement has been polarizing, hardening the position of both those who believe sexual misconduct complaints are not taken seriously enough and those who are skeptical of accusers or think they somehow \"asked for it.\"\"#MeToo does not erase that,\" she said. \"They're not going to change their mind.\"The sentencing of Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar earlier this year was the first high-profile case to unfold in a court of law after the emergence of #MeToo.It showed the danger of official inaction: The silencing or sidelining of those who tried to report his misconduct allowed him to get away with assaulting girls and young women under his care for decades.But at his sentencing, victims were , under the imprimatur of a judge who called them \"heroes.\"The critical element, experts say, was that Dr. Nassar had left behind far too many victims for people to simply ignore.In all, more than 160 teenagers and women said Dr. Nassar abused them.\"The most powerful cases are where there are multiple accusers,\" Ms. Gomez said. \"But what we don't know is what impact #MeToo would have on a single accuser.\"There are also concerns that juries may come to expect strong evidence of a pattern, the same way they have come to expect advanced forensics like DNA testing, even though it is not always available.\"If it's the case where there are 60 accusers and six come forward -- and that's the only way a case is brought -- that's a problem,\" Ms. Tuerkheimer said. \"There's the appearance that for women to be believed, it couldn't be just one, it had to be many.\"Though the jury took very little time to find Mr. Cosby guilty, Michelle Dempsey, a law professor at Villanova University, cautioned that the verdict should not be regarded as a litmus test for #MeToo, but simply as a jury's decision in a single case.More important, she said, is that the case is part of a shift in what she calls the \"norms of accountability.\" People can discuss abuse on Twitter, while many companies have beefed up harassment training.\"It's not just a matter of taking people to court,\" Dr. Dempsey said. \"We're recognizing that there's lots of ways to hold people accountable for sexual harassment and sexual violence.\""},

Including a crass one aimed at the prosecutor.The 80-year-old actor, a fixture in American family entertainment for decades, erupted in response to a suggestion by the Montgomery County district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, that his bail should be revoked because he was a potential flight risk and owned a plane.\"He doesn't have a plane, you asshole!\" Mr. Cosby shouted. It was all the more startling coming from a man once beloved as the mild Dr. Cliff Huxtable on his hit NBC sitcom, the Jell-O pudding pitchman and the whimsical and voice of the character Fat Albert.Judge Steven T. O'Neill told Mr. Cosby to pipe down -- \"Enough of that!\"But he disagreed with the notion that the actor seemed likely to skip town. He said Mr. Cosby could be released on $1 million bail but should surrender his passport and stay in his home nearby.The court outburst drew a lot of attention because -- beside the vulgarity -- it was one of the rare times Mr. Cosby has said anything in public in connection with the case or the dozens of sexual assault allegations made against him.Though he has denied all of the accusations made against him, he did not testify in his own defense during the trial that ended on Thursday.Here are a few other times he has spoken out.Mr. Cosby refused to answer questions about sexual assault during a taped interview with The Associated Press in 2014. After the interview was over, he told the reporter that he did not want anyone to see the tape.Instead, The A.P. released the tape, shining new light on the decades-old allegations and helping to ignite a firestorm that caused NBC and Netflix to cancel two of Mr. Cosby's television projects.\"There is no comment about that and I'll tell you why,\" Mr. Cosby said, when asked about the allegations. \"I think you were told, I don't want to compromise your integrity, but I don't talk about it.\"After the interview ended, while the camera was running and Mr. Cosby was still wearing a microphone, he said he wanted the tape to be disposed of.\"I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,\" he said. \"I think if you want to consider yourself to be serious, that it will not appear anywhere.\"When the reporter said he would have to ask his boss what to do with the tape, Mr. Cosby said to one of his handlers, standing slightly off camera, \"I think you need to get on the phone with his person. Immediately.\"Shortly after the A.P. interview was made public, the Radar Online site published Mr. Cosby did with The National Enquirer in 2005 about sexual assault allegations against him by Tamara Green, who said he drugged and groped her in 1970.Mr. Cosby did not explicitly deny the allegations but said he thought the media was treating him unfairly because he was famous. He was especially upset by a report that he had hired a lawyer to defend him from Ms. Green's accusation.\"I guess that a celebrity trying to protect him or herself is not supposed to use every ounce of protection?\" he said. \"But this is all about celebrity, period!\"Mr. Cosby also bemoaned the potential impact of the allegations on his loved ones.\"Who really wants to put his or her family in a position of information coming out publicly that will cause great emotional stress, challenge?\" he asked. \"The choices that the family, friends have made in looking at him or her as a good person, a wonderful person, a person to be trusted?\"In a meandering in 2015, Mr. Cosby, who frequently lectured African-American young people on personal responsibility, said he expected to be called a hypocrite.\"It's interesting. When I talk to people they will say, 'This is a situation that's unprecedented.' I, my family, my friends, I have been in this business 52 years,\" he said. \"I've never seen anything like this. And reality is the situation. And I can't speak.\"The interviewer, Linsey Davis, said during the segment that she did not think Mr. Cosby understood the \"media furor\" produced by the dozens of women who, by that point, had accused him of sexual assault.\"I can't speak on that,\" he said, when asked about the charges. \"I just don't want to argue. I don't talk about it.\""},

But the flight took more than an hour, because the plane swung out over the sea west of the Korean Peninsula, to avoid crossing the heavily militarized land border.On Friday, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Kim's son and North Korea's current leader, is expected to , where he will be greeted by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea before they sit down for talks on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone.Friday's talks, the third summit meeting between the Koreas, could produce a statement about pursuing of 1950-53, which was paused by an armistice but never formally brought to a close.But the meeting will probably be overshadowed by talks yet to come, said Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul.\"This summit will not make any important decisions,\" he said. \"The South Korean government is between a rock and a hard place. It's not in a position to discuss most of the issues which really matter. It's kind of a preliminary event to pave the road for a future meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.\" are expected to hold the first-ever meeting between a sitting American president and a leader of North Korea sometime in late May or early June. An exact date and have not been announced.Unlike the talks Friday at the DMZ, the past meetings between leaders of the Koreas were ends unto themselves. And each in its way helped prepare the two sides for Friday's discussions.A meeting between the two sides almost happened in 1994, but it was , the founder of North Korea.When the leaders of the North and South finally met in June 2000, North Korea was emerging from a famine that killed more than two million people. In the South, the former dissident Kim Dae-jung had been elected president. He called for an end to the \"Cold War style\" of relations in his .The meeting was a high point of his Sunshine Policy, which held that showering the North with warmth would help it ease out of isolation. The South sent hundreds of thousands of tons of food and fertilizer to the North each year.There were other steps aimed at improving ties, including reunions for about 16,000 members of families divided by the war. A factory park in the North Korean town of Kaesong and a resort area at Mount Kumgang, which opened in 1998, were developed with investment from the South.Kim Dae-jung was , in part for his work toward reconciliation with North Korea.But the North continued its efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Even after it acknowledged that in 2002, the South kept sending aid. The Sunshine Policy, and the 2000 summit meeting in particular, fell under harsh scrutiny after it emerged that the South had paid the North $450 million before the talks.The second inter-Korean summit meeting occurred in 2007, near the end of the five-year presidential term of Kim Dae-jung's successor, . North Korea had conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, raising questions about what the South was getting for its aid.With the likelihood of an electoral victory by conservative political rivals who were expected to end the Sunshine Policy, Mr. Roh saw the meeting as a chance to steer the future of the South's ties with the North.\"It was clear his party was going to lose in a landslide, and he understood that the conservatives had a very different idea of how to deal with North Korea: pressure, sanctions and Cold War,\" Mr. Lankov said. \"In order to prevent that, he made a last-ditch effort to prevent a slide back to mutual hostilities. He went to North Korea to basically sign a lot of agreements about future economic development.\"The conservatives did win the subsequent election, and the Sunshine Policy was declared over in 2010. But projects outlined in 2007, then shelved, could be revived by Mr. Moon and Kim Jong-un, including plans to reduce the potential for conflict in the sea west of the Korean Peninsula, where deadly clashes between the two countries have taken place.One other significant legacy from 2007 is . He was chief presidential secretary to Mr. Roh and led preparations for his meeting in Pyongyang with Kim Jong-il.While Mr. Moon has been in office for less time than Kim Jong-un or even Mr. Trump, he has deep experience with the sort of issues he will face Friday, said Gordon Flake, a Korea specialist at the University of Western Australia.\"Moon Jae-in, whether you love him or hate him, he's a South Korean president who is not naive, who is highly experienced,\" he said. \"He saw the full arc of inter-Korean relations: naive, Pollyannaish introduction, to deeply disenchanted antagonism at the end.\""},

His wit was quick, his sweaters roomy and kaleidoscopic. He could be romantic. Cliff should have been the envy of any father ever to appear on a sitcom. He was vertiginously dadly. Cliff is the reason for the cognitive dissonance we've been experiencing for the last three or four years. He seemed inseparable from the man who portrayed him.Bill Cosby was good at his job. That sums up why the Thursday is depressing -- depressing not for its shock but for the work the verdict now requires me to do. The discarding and condemning and reconsidering -- of the shows, the albums, the movies. But I don't need to watch them anymore. It's too late. I've them. I've them. I've lived them. I'm a black man, so I them.If Judge Steven T. O'Neill sent Mr. Cosby away for the rest of his life, that sentence couldn't undo what he's convicted of having done to Andrea Constand, his accuser in two trials. It also can't undo what he once did for me, which was to make me believe in myself. This is foundational, elemental, cellular stuff. There is no surgical procedure to rid me of it. Anyway, I don't want to lose that belief, just the man who ennobled me to possess it in the first place. Maybe we're all compartmentalizing.\"America's Dad\" is what we called Bill Cosby. And we called him that because, well, what a revolutionary way to put it. Through him, we were thumbing our noses at the long, dreary history for black men in America by elevating this one to a paternal Olympus. In the 1980s he made the black American family seem \"just like us.\" (That's how a recent episode of the reborn, reactionary \"Roseanne\" nonwhite families currently on television.)The Huxtables laughed and bonded and debated and lip-synced. They were glamorous and simple and extraordinarily human. And affluent. And educated. And so many different kinds of black. You'd think that all of that would make them the Howard University of African-American family life. But white people wanted to matriculate, too. So they became its Harvard. For a decade, I filed an emotional application. I had a biological family, and this TV one, a dream family, the fiction against which I measured my blood.\"Just like us\" was the dream of the show, right? \"Best behavior\" blackness. That's one way to think about it, the cynical, uncharitable, myopic way, the way you'd think about it if you wanted to psychologize Bill Cosby as Cliff Huxtable.I couldn't have known how vertiginous the entire Huxtable project was. I was, like, 10, 13, 15 years old when the show was a thing. But eventually, I could see that Cliff became a play for respectability. . But then, in 2004, at an NAACP ceremony commemorating 50 years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision, he gave , where prodding for a particular kind of self-betterment turned tsk-y. He compared incarcerated black men to jailed civil rights activists, the apples and oranges of the black criminal-justice crisis. He ruminated on names that didn't seem, to him, like Bill.\"We are not Africans,\" he said. \"Those people are not Africans, they don't know a damned thing about Africa. With names like Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed, and all that crap and all of them are in jail.\" Maybe this was Cliff unplugged -- and unhinged. ? But it was a dare to flirt with distance, to reconsider all those applications I filed, to see Bill Cosby as someone who, despite hours of comedy like \"Bill Cosby Is Not Himself These Days\" and \"Bill Cosby: Himself,\" might not be willing or able to see who \"himself\" actually is. I called this a speech, but he performed it like another standup special.This is the heavy thing about this verdict. The sorting of the ironies has been left to us. Mr. Cosby made blackness palatable to a country historically conditioned to think the worst of black people. And to pull that off, he had to find a morally impeccable presentation of himself and his race. This is what Sidney Poitier, his friend and movie partner, was always up against: inhabiting the superhumanly unimpeachable. But Mr. Cosby might have managed to pull a fast one, using his power and wealth to become the predator that white America mythologized in a campaign to terrorize, torture and kill black people for centuries. Mr. Cosby told lots of jokes. This was his sickest one.Mr. Cosby's guilty verdict happens to fall during a week in which Kanye West brought a lot of people a lot more grief, not with new music but with a blizzard of tweets that included an expressed affinity for President Trump, right down to wearing a Make America Great Again cap of his own. Mr. West began his career as a kind of black-sheep Huxtable. (His first album was \"The College Dropout.\") But he eventually gathered a sense of politics -- racialized, pro-black politics. And then he married into the Kardashian family and things got as vivid and incoherent as one of Cliff's Van Den Akker sweaters. This is how you get a blistering indictment of racial closed-mindedness like 2013's \"Black Skinhead\" but also an embrace of people who've been reluctant to shame white supremacists.This seems like a reasonable moment to wonder whether the Huxtable mold is one that needs breaking -- or at least expansion. Mr. West presents a new vexation that's the opposite of Mr. Cosby's stringent black conservatism. He can be offensive and rude and self-aggrandizing. But that mind-set also feels like a way to move beyond America's Dad. Disrespectability politics.We're in a moment of cleaving terrible people from their great work. It's a luxury conundrum, one that feels like a mockery of tremendous human suffering. With Mr. Cosby, though, these are questions worth seriously considering. How do I, at least, cleave this man from the man he seduced me into becoming?"},

Republicans were largely sympathetic.His performance, supporters said, may have saved his job and his standing with President Trump.\"It's an audience of one, and Pruitt acquitted himself well,\" said Frank V. Maisano, a principal at the law firm Bracewell, which represents energy companies that lobby the E.P.A.Mr. Pruitt, whose job security has appeared perilous recently as allegations of ethical improprieties have increased, gave a restrained performance before two House committees. His responses, however, rarely offered direct answers to questions about accusations of excessive spending or conflicts of interest.While Democrats, who have called for his resignation, sought to force Mr. Pruitt to accept culpability for a variety of ethical missteps, he denied knowledge of or responsibility for the actions in question. Republicans, after briefly chastising Mr. Pruitt in their opening remarks, asked friendly questions that appeared calculated to allow him to talk about his policy proposals.As reports about Mr. Pruitt have continued to increase, some White House staff members have urged Mr. Trump to fire the E.P.A. chief. Some Republican leaders have called for his resignation, and many in Mr. Pruitt's own party have into his actions. But analysts who watched his performance on Thursday said he did well.Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California and chairman of the appropriations subcommittee where Mr. Pruitt testified in the afternoon, called the administrator's appearance \"very professional.\"Asked if Mr. Pruitt should resign he said, \"No.\"Ultimately, of course, the only opinion about Mr. Pruitt's fate that matters is the president's.\"I think his effort will be well received by the president,\" Mr. Maisano said. He has more explaining to do, but it was a good effort to mend fences. There were no lethal blows.\"Mr. Pruitt is now the subject of , including questions about his office's illegal purchase of a secure phone booth, his condominium rental agreement with the wife of an energy lobbyist, and accusations that he demoted or sidelined E.P.A. employees who questioned his actions.Committee Democrats queried him sharply about the reports of his ethical lapses and pressed Mr. Pruitt on his rollbacks of environmental rules, in particular, a new policy, proposed this week, that would in crafting new health and environmental rules. Scientists have deplored the proposed rule, saying that it would significantly limit the agency's use of rigorous science.\"Administrator Pruitt has brought secrecy, conflicts of interest and scandal to the E.P.A.,\" said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Mr. Pruitt testified Thursday morning. \"You are unfit to hold public office and undeserving of the public trust,\" he said. \"Every indication we have is you really should resign.\"Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy committee, offered light criticism before moving on to praising Mr. Pruitt for his efforts to roll back environmental regulations. \"I am concerned that the good progress being made on the policy front is being undercut by allegations of your management of the agency and use of its resources,\" he said. \"These issues are too persistent to ignore.\"Conservative lawmakers from fossil-fuel producing states, who have long pushed for the rollback of E.P.A. regulations, bypassed even slight criticism of Mr. Pruitt, attributing the scrutiny on his actions to a political witch hunt.Representative David B. McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, told Mr. Pruitt sympathetically that the attacks on him \"have an echo of McCarthyism.\"In many ways, the past 14 months of Mr. Pruitt's tenure has been building to this moment.As Oklahoma's attorney general, he made a name for himself aggressively battling the agency he now leads. Mr. Pruitt's confirmation was fiercely opposed by Democrats, environmentalists and even . Since taking the helm of the agency, Mr. Pruitt has worked to strip the E.P.A. of funding, reduce its staff and curb its ability to develop new regulations on fossil fuel pollution.No E.P.A. director in history has achieved Mr. Pruitt's level of notoriety. Since the agency was formed, its administrators have been second-tier Washington figures. But Mr. Pruitt's antagonism toward climate science has made him a nationally-prominent and divisive figure.Critics said that more than the ethical and spending issues, the real damage to the E.P.A. has been Mr. Pruitt's systematic weakening of the agency's ability to protect the environment and public health. While Mr. Pruitt's performance in Thursday's hearings may make or break his future within the Trump administration, many said his legacy was already set.\"It's just been a flagrant, shameless series of calculated decisions to dismantle the country's most successful domestic enterprise,\" William K. Reilly, who led the E.P.A. under the first President George Bush, said of Mr. Pruitt's leadership. \"It's really a national tragedy,\" he said.At Thursday morning's hearing, Representative Joe Barton of Texas, who has long denied the overwhelming evidence of human effects on climate change, offered sympathy. \"Mr. Pruitt, you're not the first victim of Washington politics,\" he said.Democrats unsuccessfully sought to pin down Mr. Pruitt on questions about his expenditures, and to force him to accept culpability for some the actions now under investigation.Representative Tony Cardenas, a California Democrat, asked about Mr. Pruitt's soundproof booth, installed in his E.P.A. office at a cost of $43,000. The Government Accountability Office has ruled that the .\"I was not aware of the approval of the $43,000,\" Mr. Pruitt told him, \"and if I had known about it, congressman, I would not have approved it.\"Mr. Cardenas responded that \"if someone was spending $43,000 in my office, I would know about it.\"Representative Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, launched into questions about Mr. Pruitt's involvement in , referring to the purchaser of his home as a \"shell company.\"\"It's not a shell company,\" he said quickly, and added that such financial structures were commonly used to purchase real estate in Oklahoma.She then asked Mr. Pruitt whether he had paid taxes on rent he received. He said the issue had been handed over to an accountant.\"I'm not doing this to hassle you. I'm doing this as an elected official,\" Ms. DeGette said as she ended her questions. \"Everything we do has to be to the highest ethical standards.\"Representative Paul Tonko, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy's subcommittee on the Environment, pressed Mr. Pruitt on his claims that he was unaware that the E.P.A. had used an obscure legal provision to grant hefty raises to political appointees, bypassing approval by the White House. Mr. Pruitt has said the decision was taken by his chief of staff, Ryan Jackson.\"Did you authorize Mr. Jackson to sign those documents for you?\" Mr. Tonko asked.\"I was not aware of the amount and I was not aware of the bypassing that was going on,\" Mr. Pruitt replied.Even some Republicans criticized Mr. Pruitt for repeatedly blaming his staff.\"If you say give me a phone booth, and your staff does it, you should say, I'm at fault,\" said Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the House Energy subcommittee, speaking to reporters after the morning hearing. \"It's never good to blame your staff. Or at least do it behind closed doors.\"And Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat, used her turn at questioning to try to get Mr. Pruitt to accept culpability. \"You have a solid record of violating ethics rules from the state level to the federal government,\" she told Mr. Pruitt. \"I think it's an embarrassment.\" And then she asked, \"Do you have any remorse? Yes or no?\"Mr. Pruitt responded: \"I think there are changes I've made already. I've made a change from first class to coach travel.\" Ms. Eshoo returned to her call for a yes-or-no answer, and asked Mr. Pruitt whether he would reimburse the government. He launched into a long response, but she cut him off.\"With all due respect, I may be elected, but I'm not a fool,\" she said. \"This is not 'dodge-question' day.\""},

In the last few years, he has lost television deals, and Now with the guilty verdict, he is facing possible prison time, up to 10 years, though the sentences could be served concurrently.Mr. Cosby's first trial ended in a hung jury last June. Here is how his retrial in Norristown, Pa., unfolded and ended with a conviction:Ms. Constand, who works for the Temple University women's basketball team, meets Mr. Cosby, a Temple alumnus and supporter, at one of the team's games in Philadelphia.The month that Ms. Constand said Mr. Cosby assaulted her at his home after giving her wine and three pills that left her \"frozen.\" Besides the issue of whether the encounter was consensual, Mr. Cosby's team has questioned whether it occurred earlier than Ms. Constand described, which could place the episode too far outside the statute of limitations for Mr. Cosby to be held criminally liable.Ms. Constand, who has left Temple and moved back home to Toronto, tells her mother that Mr. Cosby assaulted her about a year earlier. They call him and contact the Canadian police. Three days later, Mr. Cosby returns the call, apologizes, declines to identify the pills, but suggests the sex was consensual.The Montgomery County district attorney at the time, Bruce L. Castor Jr., decides not to charge Mr. Cosby, citing \"insufficient credible and admissible evidence.\"Ms. Constand sues Mr. Cosby. Eventually a dozen women will agree to present testimony of similar behavior on his part.In deposition testimony, Mr. Cosby admits to obtaining quaaludes to give to young women for sex. Ms. Constand's suit is later settled, and both sign a nondisclosure agreement. The deposition and settlement amount are not made public at that point.During a comedy routine, Hannibal Buress . A video of the moment goes viral, prompting many other women to come forward with accusations.A judge releases parts of Mr. Cosby's deposition in the 2005 civil case. The criminal investigation is later reopened and detectives visit Toronto to interview Ms. Constand.Montgomery County voters elect Kevin R. Steele as district attorney. He had criticized the 2005 decision not to prosecute Mr. Cosby. on charges of aggravated indecent assault. Based on the timing described by Ms. Constand, the charges come just before the expiration of the 12-year statute of limitations for the charge.Mr. Cosby's first trial ends in a mistrial after jurors remain deadlocked following six days of deliberations.The retrial begins. For the first time, the amount of Mr. Cosby's settlement with Ms. Constand is revealed: . And this time, the judge allows five women to testify that Mr. Cosby assaulted them to how Ms. Constand says she was attacked. In the first trial, only one other woman was permitted to take the stand.Mr. Cosby has a new witness, too: who said Ms. Constand once told her she could make money by falsely accusing a prominent person.A jury found of assaulting Ms. Constand: penetration with lack of consent, penetration while unconscious and penetration after administering an intoxicant. These are felonies, each punishable by up to 10 years in state prison, though the sentences could be served concurrently."},

SHEAR", "title": "Isolation of White House Medical Unit Hid Ronny Jackson From Scrutiny", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/us/politics/ronny-jackson-nomination-withdrawn.html", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- To senior White House aides serving the last three presidents, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson was the war-tested doctor who served in Iraq, helped them cope with their high-pressure jobs and ran his medical staff with the rigor befitting his rank of rear admiral in the Navy.But inside the White House medical unit, a military-run office with a few dozen doctors and nurses, Dr. Jackson was viewed as a bully and someone who kept sloppy medical records, drank too much and loosely dispensed strong drugs to curry favor with the powerful politicians and political aides he admired. Three current and former colleagues said that Dr. Jackson was sometimes intoxicated during overseas trips and that staff members were often ordered to leave a bottle of rum and a Diet Coke in his hotel room.On Thursday, Dr. Jackson withdrew from consideration as the secretary of Veterans Affairs after those and other allegations about his behavior . Dr. Jackson, Mr. Trump and numerous White House officials dating to the Obama presidency insisted none of it was true.\"These false allegations have become a distraction for this president,\" Dr. Jackson said.Dr. Robert G. Darling, a former White House physician to President Bill Clinton and a retired Navy emergency medicine doctor, said, \"This is a guy who served this country, who is in this job pretty reluctantly, and now he's getting hung out to dry.\"But in a White House where everybody appears to be in everyone else's business, a picture has emerged of a medical unit oddly disconnected from the larger executive offices of the president, where a small team of military medical professionals reports up a narrow chain of command out of view from the political realm. Witnesses to Dr. Jackson's behavior spoke on the condition of anonymity because they continue to serve in the military.Dr. Jackson's medical unit operates inside the White House, not far from the West Wing, where the president and his aides work. But an isolated managerial bubble allowed Dr. Jackson to serve three presidents for a decade while escaping scrutiny of alleged abuses of power and position. Dr. Jackson's employees were not subordinates of the White House chief of staff or the president's lawyer. Instead, the medical unit reported through a military chain of command to the little-known White House Military Office.When work conditions grew intolerable in the unit, it was the Navy's inspector general that stepped in, rendering a judgment in 2012 that the environment was \"toxic\" and that one or both of the top two doctors, including Dr. Jackson, should go. But little appears to have changed.In interviews with more than 24 people -- including some of Dr. Jackson's former subordinates and a dozen White House political aides in the Trump and Obama administrations -- officials said members of the medical and political staffs hardly came into contact with one another outside of routine medical treatment. They operated under different rules of behavior and rarely socialized together, even on long trips to foreign countries.Mr. Trump's decision to nominate Dr. Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, the second-largest bureaucracy in the federal government, brought the two worlds into collision, surfacing allegations against Dr. Jackson that may otherwise never have emerged.The aftermath has raised difficult questions for officials in all three administrations, who either did not know about the accusations or looked the other way. Some said they were vaguely aware of complaints from Mr. Jackson's subordinates about his abrasive manner, which several described as frat-boy behavior; most said they largely dismissed it as griping from employees who belonged to a separate chain of command.\"I didn't see any of the alleged behaviors,\" said David Axelrod, who served as Mr. Obama's senior adviser from 2009 to 2011. \"My experience was consistently positive.\"A few said they had heard whispers of drinking, though all of the former White House officials said they never saw him drunk on the job. But many said Dr. Jackson earned the nicknames \"Candyman\" and \"Dr. Feelgood\" because he dispensed sleeping pills, muscle relaxants and other drugs with such ease.One former senior White House aide who traveled regularly with the president said Dr. Jackson was known to be an eager and generous provider of Ambien, a sleep aid, and Provigil, a drug that promotes wakefulness, to staff members on presidential trips, which he would dispense in plastic baggies on Air Force One. The former aide said Dr. Jackson also doled out stronger substances, such as Xanax and the addictive opioid Percocet, readily offering them when he believed they might be helpful.\"Hey, you're going through a tough time,\" he would say, according to the former aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"Why don't you take a bottle of this?\"Mr. Trump lamented on Thursday Dr. Jackson's decision to withdraw from consideration, calling him \"an admiral, highly respected, a real leader\" during The president added: \"These are all false accusations. These are false. They're trying to destroy a man.\"And friends of Dr. Jackson said that they were stunned by the allegations, and insisted that he must be the victim of disgruntled former colleagues who are trying to derail a successful career.\"I've literally never heard a bad word said about him by anybody that I know who's worked with him,\" said Dr. Gregory Ciottone, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. \"By my own personal experience, he's really incredibly highly respected and just a good person.\"Dr. Darling, who said he had breakfast recently with Dr. Jackson at the Army and Navy Club in Washington, said he never heard any rumors or speculation about alcohol abuse. He said it was unlikely to be true given the kind of security clearances that Dr. Jackson requires to do his job.\"Top Secret, it's called Yankee White,\" Dr. Darling said. \"That means you've got direct access to the president of the United States. We go up to his personal residence. We can go there unaccompanied without the Secret Service or anything. Not too many people get to do that.\"Dr. Jackson's appointment to the White House medical unit came after a stint in western Iraq from 2005 to 2006, during some of the worst months of the conflict, where Americans were killed and maimed almost daily from roadside bombs, insurgent attacks and snipers.He was stationed at Al Taqaddum air base, a key hub wedged between Falluja and Ramadi, where he worked with a shock trauma platoon as the physician in charge of resuscitative medicine. In 2005, Al Taqaddum was one of three bases in one of the more volatile parts of Anbar Province that had such a platoon.The small team of doctors and nurses often acted as the first line of medical care after an American was injured on the battlefield, providing emergency-room level care and conducting field surgical procedures before stabilizing patients and airlifting them to a larger air base.At the White House, his service was hailed by the three presidents he served. In 2016, as President Barack Obama prepared to leave office, he called Dr. Jackson \"an exceptional physician and leader\" who as the official presidential doctor had \"earned my complete trust and respect.\"But those who worked closely with Dr. Jackson in the medical office insist that he was skilled at promoting himself to the president and top White House aides, even as he treated his nurses and doctors badly.Three former employees of the medical unit said Thursday that they had made official complaints with the legal counsel of the White House Military Office or other leaders in the unit as far back as the Obama administration. All three said the complaints seemed to go unaddressed. Officials with the military office did not respond to requests for comment.One person familiar with the medical unit recalled an overseas trip during the Obama administration in which Dr. Jackson showed up to board Air Force One after a day of drinking. The person, who had firsthand knowledge of the episode, said there was no choice given Dr. Jackson's place in the chain of command but to give him the medical bag and allow him to board the plane, where he would be the primary physician attending to Mr. Obama on a long international flight.The same person expressed awareness of multiple episodes in which Dr. Jackson asked subordinates to write themselves prescriptions for controlled drugs, pick them up, then deliver them to him for administration to patients. One former colleague described similar situations.The person also had \"firsthand knowledge\" of Dr. Jackson verbally abusing subordinates, including nurses, physicians assistants and doctors, sometimes for extended periods of time, with swear words.White House officials said Thursday that despite the allegations, Dr. Jackson remains in his role as the president's physician, one he has filled since 2013. In January, Dr. Jackson praised after conducting a battery of tests and examinations for his annual physical, earning plaudits from the president and scorn from Mr. Trump's critics.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement only that Dr. Jackson \"is a doctor in the United States Navy assigned to the White House and is here at work today.\"Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior adviser at the White House, tweeted her support for Dr. Jackson.\"Admiral Ronny Jackson is a man of exceptional integrity, character and intellect,\" . \"We are grateful for his long and distinguished service to our Nation and look forward to continuing to see his warm smile each day at the White House!\""},

Chief Mike Pompeo to Be Secretary of State", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/us/politics/mike-pompeo-secretary-of-state.html", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- The Senate easily confirmed Mike Pompeo on Thursday as the United States' 70th secretary of state, elevating the current C.I.A. director and an outspoken foreign policy hawk to be the nation's top diplomat.In the end, the 57-to-42 tally lacked the drama of other nail-biting confirmation votes in the Trump era. This week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the nominee's main Republican antagonist, bowed to pressure from President Trump to drop his objections. Ultimately, seven members of the Senate Democratic caucus -- five of whom face re-election this year in states that Mr. Trump won in 2016 -- joined a united Republican conference to support Mr. Pompeo's confirmation.Shortly after the vote at the Capitol, Mr. Pompeo went across the street to the Supreme Court, where he was sworn in by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Mr. Pompeo then dashed to Joint Base Andrews, where a plane was waiting to fly him to Brussels for a meeting of NATO allies. Senior staff on the plane greeted him with applause.Over the next three days, he will also travel to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Jerusalem; and Amman, Jordan. Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Pompeo's predecessor, never went to Jerusalem out of deference to Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, whose portfolio included an effort to negotiate a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians.Mr. Pompeo's agenda is already packed, with crucial deadlines in the coming weeks involving Russia, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela. And he must face these challenges while trying to repair a State Department damaged under the tenure of Mr. Tillerson and the crucial alliances frayed during the Trump presidency.Senators were mindful of the need to get Mr. Pompeo in place, given the crush of work facing him. His confirmation seemed all but assured after Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a Democrat who is running for re-election in a state that Mr. Trump won by a wide margin, said last week that she would support him.Four other Democrats who are also running for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump -- Senators Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Bill Nelson of Florida -- also voted to confirm Mr. Pompeo.For Democrats who will be on the ballot in Trump states, a vote against Mr. Pompeo could have exposed them to attacks from the Republicans, including Mr. Trump, eager to label them obstructionists.Mr. Pompeo also managed to avoid what would have been an embarrassing rebuke on his way into the new post, as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had seemed likely to not recommend his confirmation. But Mr. Paul, an outspoken foe of interventionist foreign policy, .As secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo will also have to navigate the rivalries within the Trump administration. At the White House, John R. Bolton, the administration's third national security adviser in a little over a year, is presiding over . Mr. Pompeo must forge a working relationship with Mr. Bolton as he creates alliances with the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; and Mr. Kushner.Mr. Pompeo's early military career -- he attended West Point and became a tank commander before leaving for Harvard Law School -- could endear him to Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mattis, both former four-star generals.But handling Mr. Kushner will be a delicate matter. Mr. Kushner's diplomatic portfolio includes and even as Mr. Trump pursues his hard-line immigration policies and wall on the southern border with Mexico.Mr. Pompeo will also have to mend fences with the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, whose relationship with Mr. Tillerson was so strained that she . She was absent from this week's state dinner with President Emmanuel Macron of France.Mr. Pompeo's year of service as the director of the C.I.A. has given him a running start. He forged an while giving the president daily intelligence briefings. The trust between them is so strong that Mr. Trump sent to pave the way for a high-stakes summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, now expected to take place in June.But first, Mr. Pompeo must deal with Russia.Within hours of his landing in Europe, he will preside over a breakfast meeting at NATO Headquarters to discuss new measures to counter an increasingly aggressive Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who American intelligence officials say ordered the annexation of Crimea, the intervention in Ukraine, the hacking of the American election in 2016 and the murders or attempted murders of countless rivals, including a former Russian spy living in Britain. He has maintained his military and diplomatic support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria despite the massacre of civilians and the use of chemical weapons.The gathering will thrust Mr. Pompeo into the , which is staffed with hawks pushing for an increasingly tough line against Moscow but is headed by a president who hopes for improving ties while facing an investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election campaign.In two weeks, Mr. Trump is also set to announce whether he will exit the Iran nuclear deal, struck by President Barack Obama and the leaders of Russia, Britain, France, Germany and China. Leaving the deal would further fray ties with Europe, but failing to scrap the deal would violate a core campaign pledge.Mr. Pompeo was once a voluble member of the Republican chorus opposing the pact. But in his confirmation hearing, Mr. Pompeo promised to try to preserve the accord, one of several pledges he made that were at odds with his record as a four-term Tea Party congressman from Kansas. This week, .In addition, Mr. Pompeo will have to help forge a strategy to deal with a splintering Syria, something administration officials have openly acknowledged they lack, decide and choose whether to impose new sanctions against Venezuela after the expected re-election of President Nicolas Maduro on May 20 in a campaign widely seen as undemocratic.Although a decided hawk and more socially conservative than much of his staff, Mr. Pompeo's expected arrival has been greeted with quiet relief at the State Department, which has yet to recover from the tenure of Mr. Tillerson, who spent $12 million on a that drove away many of the country's diplomats and left behind a demoralized and disorganized staff."},

Or two.By the time the sun set Thursday, whose life had been picked apart for public consumption, and facing possible criminal prosecution.A ride on President Trump's bullet train can be thrilling, but it is often a brutal journey that leaves some bloodied by the side of the tracks. In only 15 months in office, Mr. Trump has burned through a record number of advisers and associates who have found themselves in legal, professional or personal trouble, or even all three.Half of the top aides who came to the White House with Mr. Trump in 2017 are gone, many under painful circumstances, either because they fell out with the boss or came under the harsh scrutiny that comes with him. Some of the president's longest-serving aides have left with bruises. His son and son-in-law have hired lawyers and been interrogated. Even his lawyers now have lawyers as they face inquiries of their own.Proximity to Mr. Trump has been a crushing experience for many who arrived with stellar careers and independent reputations yet ended up losing so much. ran the world's largest energy company. was a respected doctor and a of the medical world. Lt. Gen. was an admired warrior. So was . held a safe seat in Congress. So did . Now all of them are known for unhappy associations with Mr. Trump.All of them, of course, had varying degrees of responsibility for the troubles that would ultimately befall them. But like Dr. Jackson and Mr. Cohen, they have all emerged from the other end of Mr. Trump's world deeply damaged. And their collective fate serves as a cautionary tale for those who might otherwise be tempted to join the president's team but worry that they, too, might pay a price that would be too costly.Mr. Trump expressed outrage on Thursday about the toll exacted on some people close to him. Dr. Jackson, the White House physician and rear admiral who for secretary of Veterans Affairs after accusations of drinking on official trips and badgering his staff, is \"an incredible man\" whom Democrats were \"trying to destroy,\" The president attributed it to the toxic atmosphere of the capital, saying he warned Dr. Jackson. \"I did say welcome to Washington,\" he said. \"Welcome to the swamp. Welcome to the world of politics.\"Mr. Trump likewise said that Mr. Cohen, his longtime lawyer who , the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election and now faces a federal investigation, is \"a great guy\" who \"did absolutely nothing wrong\" in that matter.But as he has with other advisers who have gotten in trouble, the president also distanced himself, suggesting that Mr. Cohen was in trouble for business dealings separate from any legal representation he had done for Mr. Trump. \"I'm not involved, and I've been told I'm not involved,\" he said.Over many decades, people who have entered Mr. Trump's circle have discovered that they are bit actors in a movie he sees himself starring in.\"People are not people to him, they are instruments of his ego. And when they serve his ego, they survive, and when they don't, they pass into the night,\" said Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter on \"The Art of the Deal,\" Mr. Trump's first book. \"Ultimately, the fate of anyone who casts their lot with Trump is -- you are passing through. And I just can't think of anybody for whom it is not true.\"Jack O'Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, and a vocal critic of his former boss, said many people have cycled through his world remarkably quickly without leaving much of an impression on Mr. Trump.\"This is an individual who completely lacks compassion and empathy, and therefore the recycling of people, people crashing and burning, it means nothing to him,\" Mr. O'Donnell said. \"He might put on a public frown for a day because he's upset that, in his mind, the admiral got railroaded out. But Trump couldn't care less about the admiral.\"The president tapped Dr. Jackson because he had come to like him and was impressed by him even though he had little management experience to run the government's second-largest department. Shortly after his selection, several senior White House officials warned Dr. Jackson that it was a bad idea and that it was likely to end poorly.But Mr. Trump is a transactional person, and many have made transactional decisions to work for him understanding the risks. For some, it is a sense of public service and duty to country. For others, it is a calculation that the return on investment will be worth it. Indeed, Mr. Cohen has attracted enormous attention over the years as he built business ties because of his affiliation with Mr. Trump.Some who have come and gone managed to benefit from the experience in their own way despite the ordeal. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary who was mocked on \"Saturday Night Live\" and maligned by the president and the news media, nonetheless has received lucrative speaking contracts and has a book coming out in July. Mr. Tillerson and Gary D. Cohn, the former national economics adviser, lost power struggles, but both still have hundreds of millions of dollars to console themselves, and friends say no one should feel sorry for them.Still, former advisers like , and have all been charged with or pleaded guilty to crimes and are looking at prison time.Others worry they may face the same fate. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency whose spending and security practices were spotlighted Thursday at , may yet lose his job.Other presidents have seen associates get caught up in investigations or scandals that were highlighted or magnified because of their closeness. Plenty of advisers, aides and friends of and met untimely ends to their political careers or even went to prison, and critics of both presidents often said they did not seem to care about the consequences to those around them.The closer someone gets to a president, the harsher the spotlight can be. Many who seek the power and stature of the White House somehow convince themselves that their own foibles or misdeeds will not be exposed, only to learn otherwise, or become intoxicated by their new positions of influence and exercise poor judgment. And Washington can be especially unforgiving. \"Here, ruining people is considered sport,\" Vincent W. Foster Jr., a longtime Clinton friend and aide, wrote before killing himself in 1993.Several people who have been close to Mr. Trump over the years say that he is exceptionally good at rationalizing his own behavior to himself, and compartmentalizing the types of personal catastrophes that would leave other people emotionally ravaged.\"I think that loyalty has always been a one-way street with Trump, and he doesn't really care about the wreckages he engenders as long as he comes out where he wants to be,\" said Tim O'Brien, a biographer who was sued by Mr. Trump over a book reporting that Mr. Trump had inflated his net worth.\"Ronny Jackson's reputation would never have been in play had the president not put him up for this job,\" Mr. O'Brien said, adding that in Mr. Trump's mind, the issue is, \"Ronny was great, but Washington is a snake pit.\"Michael D'Antonio, another Trump biographer, said, \"Anyone who engages with the president and, before that, with him as a business person, had to practice self-defense even if they were his allies.\"\"All that matters to him,\" he added, \"is what you say and do in the moment in front of him.\""},

Jones, a former federal judge, was selected on Thursday to oversee the process of screening materials seized in a recent F.B.I. raid from President Trump's personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen.It has been two weeks since , apartment and hotel room and hauled away at least eight boxes of documents and more than a dozen cellphones, iPads and computer hard drives. But because the government and lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump have been sparring about whether the seized materials are privileged, the prosecutors working on the case have not yet been able to look at them.The selection of Ms. Jones, by a federal judge in Manhattan, to determine whether any of the materials are protected by attorney-client privilege appeared to resolve, at least for now, the dispute over who should be permitted to review the materials and how the process should proceed.Bringing on Ms. Jones to serve as what is known as a special master could speed up the review, but it also introduced another layer of scrutiny -- and thus a note of caution -- to the process.The judge who selected her, Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court, said that she had asked Ms. Jones how much time she could devote to the special master's role. \"She has committed 90 percent of her time to it and perhaps more if needed,\" Judge Wood said.She added, \"If at any point it turns out that the special master review process is going too slowly, I'll revisit the question of the scope of the special master's role.\"At the hearing, prosecutors said that they had already started handing over portions of the seized materials to Mr. Cohen's lawyers, a process that could take weeks to finish. Under a system laid out by Judge Wood, Mr. Cohen's lawyers will now begin to screen them for attorney-client privilege and will pass on those records that pertain to Mr. Trump to his own lawyers, who will do the same.At the same time, Ms. Jones will begin a simultaneous review, setting aside records that she herself concludes may be privileged. Each of the parties, Judge Wood said, will have the right to challenge decisions made by the others.While highly technical, the findings about which records are privileged could shape the contours of the government's investigation into Mr. Cohen. That inquiry is seeking to determine whether he broke the law by attempting to tamp down negative news coverage of the president in the run-up to the 2016 election.Judge Wood made it clear that Ms. Jones was well positioned to serve as an arbiter. For 17 years, she served on the bench in the same courthouse where the Cohen case is now being heard. Before that, she worked as a prosecutor in the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. Ms. Jones was also once a senior aide to Robert M. Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney.As a private lawyer, Ms. Jones has worked as a monitor or a \"neutral party\" in disputes. In 2014, she was picked to hear the appeal by Ray Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens player, of the National Football League's decision to suspend him over a domestic-abuse case.In the past week or so, Mr. Cohen has been shedding legal exposure in separate but related court cases. On Wednesday, he filed papers in California in a lawsuit filed last month against President Trump by Stephanie Clifford, a former pornographic film star better known as Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with the president.Mr. Cohen has admitted to paying Ms. Clifford $130,000 in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement in October 2016, a month before the election. Ms. Clifford's suit seeks to invalidate the agreement, alleging it was void because Mr. Trump never put his name to it.Mr. Cohen also last week against the political research firm Fusion GPS and the website BuzzFeed related to their publication of the so-called Steele dossier, an intelligence report alleging ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. In the suits, Mr. Cohen had accused both companies of disseminating the dossier even though both knew that it contained what he described as lies.All three moves may help Mr. Cohen avoid releasing documents or providing answers to probing questions that could have been used against him in the criminal investigation. That inquiry is said to be focusing not only on hush-money payments that Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Clifford, but also on his role in keeping quiet another woman who claims she had an affair with Mr. Trump, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model.On Thursday, Ms. Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, filed a motion on her behalf to formally intervene in Mr. Cohen's case in New York.In the motion, Mr. Avenatti said that Ms. Clifford's former lawyer, Keith Davidson, had communicated with Mr. Cohen about hush-money payments he had made to her, and that records of those dealings were now in the hands of prosecutors. Mr. Davidson that he was contacted by federal authorities after the raids on Mr. Cohen, and that he had shared some of his records with the government.Judge Wood declined to rule from the bench on Ms. Clifford's motion to intervene. And when asked in court what he and Ms. Clifford wanted, Mr. Avenatti admitted that it wasn't much.\"A seat at the table,\" he said."},

Cohen, on Thursday, saying that a federal criminal investigation was focused on Mr. Cohen's business dealings and had nothing to do with his legal representation of the president.The president acknowledged that Mr. Cohen represents him in connection with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels who has asserted that she had extramarital sexual relations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen shortly before the 2016 election as part of what she now calls a \"hush agreement.\"But Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen did nothing wrong in that matter. Mr. Cohen handled just \"a tiny, tiny little fraction\" of his legal work, Mr. Trump said. \"But Michael would represent me and represent me on some things,\" the president said in a telephone call to \"Fox & Friends,\" his favorite cable television show. \"He represents me, like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me.\"\"From what I see,\" he continued, \"he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going into this, which would have been a problem.\"\"From what I understand, they're looking at his businesses,\" he added. Discussing Mr. Cohen's decision to decline to testify in a lawsuit by Ms. Clifford, right against self-incrimination, Mr. Trump said he was probably just following the advice of his own lawyers. \"I'm not involved, and I've been told I'm not involved.\"The president's mention of Ms. Clifford was striking because he has mainly shown restraint in not discussing her.And his comments about Mr. Cohen were among his most extensive since the F.B.I. after obtaining a warrant from a federal court. Mr. Trump complained on Twitter afterward that the raid meant that But his remarks on Fox suggested that the investigation did not involve Mr. Cohen's legal work.\"Michael is a businessman, he's got a business. He also practices law,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they're looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business.\"Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford's lawyer, seized on the president's comments, suggesting they would help trying to nullify the 2016 nondisclosure agreement by proving Mr. Trump's involvement in the effort to keep her quiet before the election.\"Thank you @foxandfriends for having Mr. Trump on this morning to discuss Michael Cohen and our case,\" he wrote on Twitter.He went on MSNBC and CNN to reinforce his point. \"This case gets better every day, every hour, and one of the reasons why it gets better is that they step in to every trap that we lay,\" he said on CNN.\"The president's statements this morning are very, very damaging to him in our case,\" Mr. Avenatti added. \"It directly contradicts what he said on Air Force One relating to his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the agreement of $130,000.\"He said that \"it is going to add considerable momentum to our efforts to depose the president and place him under oath, because now we have two contrary statements, made within the same month, relating to what he knew about the agreement, what he didn't know, what his relationship was with Michael Cohen and we're going to utilize that statement today to argue for his deposition.\"The federal investigation is that Mr. Cohen made to or helped arrange for Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who has also said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Despite his comments on Thursday, Mr. Trump's advisers have concluded that the investigation into Mr. Cohen poses than even the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.The president's discussion of Mr. Cohen's legal troubles came during an expansive, wide-ranging and at times rambling half-hour telephone interview on Fox. At times, it sounded as if he was shouting into the phone.Without being asked, Mr. Trump hit on many of his favorite subjects, including his win in the Electoral College in 2016, the no-knock on the home of his former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and a CNN debate during the Democratic primaries in 2016 when 's campaign got advance warning of some of the questions, according to emails stolen by Russians and released by WikiLeaks.Unprompted, he attacked former Secretary of State John Kerry (\"the worst negotiator I've ever seen\"), \"Sleepy Eyes\" Chuck Todd of \"Meet the Press\" on NBC News (\"the guy shouldn't even be on the show\") and Andrew G. McCabe, the fired former deputy director of the F.B.I. (part of a \"crooked\" bureau leadership). The president indicated he had watched a CNN town-hall-style program on Wednesday featuring James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he , who is now one of his toughest critics (\"a lying leaker\").Even the Fox hosts seemed concerned as the president railed at length about the \"fake news\" media. \"I'm not your doctor, Mr. President, but I would recommend you watch less of them,\" one of the hosts, Brian Kilmeade, told him.Mr. Trump presented himself as the victim of a far-reaching conspiracy by an establishment out to stop him from changing the system. \"I'm fighting a battle against a horrible group of deep-seated people, drain the swamp, that are coming up with all sorts of phony charges against me, and they're not bringing up real charges against the other side,\" he said. \"So we have a phony deal going on, and it's a cloud over my head.\"Nonetheless, he gave himself an \"A-plus\" for his first 15 months in office -- pointing to the tax cuts he signed into law, his efforts to roll back business and environmental regulations and his appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court -- despite Mr. Mueller's investigation into whether there were ties between his campaign and in 2016 and whether he has obstructed justice since then.The president raised again his disappointment with the Justice Department and said the special counsel investigation and raids on his former associates' properties were a \"disgrace.\" He said he had tried not to interfere in Justice Department matters. But he warned that \"at some point I won't.\"Mr. Trump has for months encouraged the Justice Department to investigate his political rivals. \"Our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff, not the nonsense of collusion with Russia,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There is no collusion with me and Russia.\"He asserted Mr. Mueller's office is a coven of Democrats out to get him. \"If you take a look, they're so conflicted, the people that are doing the investigation, you have 13 people that are Democrats, you have Hillary Clinton people, you have people that worked on Hillary Clinton's foundation,\" he said. \"I don't mean Democrats, I mean, like, the real deal.\"Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican who was appointed F.B.I. director by President , has assembled a team of career prosecutors and veteran lawyers, some of whom while in the private sector gave contributions to Mrs. Clinton or President . Mr. Mueller's defenders say he recruited his team based on expertise and skill, not on partisan affiliations.Democrats cited the president's latest attacks on the Justice Department and Mr. Mueller's office to argue for l by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday meant to prevent Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Mueller without cause by allowing a dismissed special counsel to appeal to a panel of judges. That bill now goes to the full Senate.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Mr. Trump's comments were \"embarrassing to America.\"\"The president seems to live in an alternative reality,\" Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"He says things that are patently false and he thinks just by saying them they become true. The amount of 180-degree turns, name calling and blaming -- you watch the president this morning and the way he acted, it is so unbecoming of a president and democracy.\"In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump also said that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, who is poised to be confirmed as secretary of state, was not originally scheduled to meet with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, during a secret Easter visit. \"He wasn't supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They arranged, actually, while he was there to say hello.\"But, he added, \"it was more than a hello. They got along. They were with each other for more than an hour.\" They \"had a great meeting.\"Mr. Trump said his own coming meeting with Mr. Kim may or may not work out. \"It could be I walk out quickly, with respect,\" he said. \"It could be that the meeting doesn't even take place. Who knows?\"But he credited his bellicose rhetoric with making a breakthrough with North Korea. \"Everybody said, 'This guy's going to get us into nuclear war,'\" he said, referring to himself. \"Let me tell you, the nuclear war would have happened if you had had weak people.\""},

{"author": "THOMAS FULLER", "title": "How a Genealogy Site Led to the Front Door of the Golden State Killer Suspect", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/us/golden-state-killer.html", "contents": "SACRAMENTO -- The Golden State Killer raped and murdered victims all across the state of California in an era before Google searches and social media, a time when the police relied on shoe leather, not cellphone records or big data.But it was technology that got him. The suspect, Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was arrested by the police on Tuesday. Investigators accuse him of committing more than 50 rapes and 12 murders.Investigators used DNA from crime scenes that had been stored all these years and plugged the genetic profile of the suspected assailant into an online genealogy database. They found distant relatives of Mr. DeAngelo's and, despite his years of eluding the authorities, traced their DNA to his front door.\"We found a person that was the right age and lived in this area -- and that was Mr. DeAngelo,\" said Steve Grippi, the assistant chief in the Sacramento district attorney's office.Investigators then obtained what Anne Marie Schubert, the Sacramento district attorney, called \"abandoned\" DNA samples from Mr. DeAngelo. \"You leave your DNA in a place that is a public domain,\" she said.The test result confirmed the match to more than 10 murders in California. Ms. Schubert's office then obtained a second sample and came back with the same positive result, matching the full DNA profile.Those who had investigated the case for years in vain were ecstatic by the sudden breakthrough. \"He was totally off the radar till just a week ago, and it was a lead they got, somehow they got information and through checking family or descendants -- it was pretty complicated the way they did it -- they were able to get him on the radar,\" said Ray Biondi, 81, who was the lieutenant in charge of the homicide bureau of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department during the crime spree.Representatives at 23andMe and some other gene testing services denied on Thursday that they had been involved in identifying the killer.The big players in commercial DNA testing -- including 23andMe and AncestryDNA -- extract genetic profiles from the saliva that customers send to the company in a tube by mail. It would not be easy for law enforcement to upload a profile to one of those sites. Over the past few years, numerous smaller genealogical websites have emerged, however, giving customers more avenues to upload a DNA profile and search for relatives.If law enforcement located the suspect through a genealogy site, it could raise ethical issues, particularly if individuals did not consent to having their genetic profiles searched against crime scene evidence.The Golden State Killer, also known as the East Area Rapist, tormented his victims with sadistic rituals. Some he shot and killed with a firearm. Others were bludgeoned to death with whatever he could find -- in one case a piece of firewood. He had many trademarks: He wore a mask, he bound his victims' hands. He started by raping single women and then went on to raping married women with their husbands present, before killing them both.Among the numerous serial killers who stalked America in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s -- the Zodiac Killer, the Son of Sam, to name two -- the Golden State Killer was among the most notorious.Ms. Schubert has been central to the efforts to find the killer. Her childhood in the Sacramento suburb of Arden-Arcade, just miles from where the suspect prowled through houses and raped women, was marked by the terror of wondering if she or people she knew might be next.\"It wasn't a matter of if he was coming, it was when,\" Ms. Schubert said. Her parents were \"not gun people,\" she said, but her father bought a firearm. Her mother kept an ice pick under her pillow when she slept.Monica Miller, who was in charge of the Sacramento F.B.I. field office from 2013 to 2017, said that when she retired, the case of the Golden State Killer was cold. She said that Ms. Schubert, \"was central in leading this, convincing people this was worth pursuing.\" For the people of Sacramento, she added, \"it was almost an open wound. People would still talk about it. He was a phantom or a ghost in people's minds.\"In her career as a district attorney, Ms. Schubert championed DNA technology and taught courses about cold cases, creating a unit in the Sacramento district attorney's office to pursue them. Eighteen years ago she reached out to an investigator from Contra Costa County who specialized in the East Area Rapist, beginning a collaboration to re-energize the case.Two years ago she convened a task force on the 40th anniversary of the attacks in the Sacramento suburbs. It was the work of that group -- a collaboration with counties in Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area and the F.B.I. -- that helped solve the case, Ms. Schubert said.Many questions remain about the suspect. Did his family or his former colleagues have hints about his grisly past? Why did he appear to stop his spree of rapes and murders in 1986? Did he leverage his job as a police officer to elude detection?All of these questions swirled in conversations among residents of Citrus Heights, Mr. DeAngelo's neighborhood. They awoke on Wednesday shocked to find that their neighbor, a man who liked to tinker with his motorcycle in front of his neat beige stucco house, had been accused of being one of America's most notorious serial rapists.\"It's crazy -- they were looking for this guy for 40 years and he was right here under our noses,\" said Ashley Piorun, who lives five houses down from Mr. DeAngelo. \"We were shellshocked to find out.\"This suburban neighborhood of well-kept homes, northeast of Sacramento, is a classic California housing tract of looping cul-de-sacs and towering palm trees. Ms. Piorun calls it a \"quiet, sweet, boring neighborhood.\"Paul Sanchietti, another neighbor, said he had taken an interest in the case six months ago and combed through the Wikipedia entry that listed all of the grisly and sadistic crimes the Golden State Killer was accused of committing.\"Here I was looking up the guy on Wikipedia and he was five doors down,\" Mr. Sanchietti said of Mr. DeAngelo.From the outside, the house seemed meticulously maintained. The roof is new, the garden hose is perfectly coiled, the landscaping of sod, wood chips and decorative rocks is neat.Mr. Sanchietti said he had nothing more than polite interactions with Mr. DeAngelo over the past two decades, but like other neighbors, he remembered Mr. DeAngelo as having a temper.\"He would get volatile,\" Mr. Sanchietti said. \"He would be out here tending to his car and he would get very angry. There were a lot of four letter words.\"\"Every neighborhood has some strange little dude,\" Mr. Sanchietti said. \"But for him to be a serial murderer and rapist -- that never crossed my mind.\""},

Mueller III to appeal their firing to a panel of judges and possibly be reinstated.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, that he will not bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. But with four Republicans, including the committee's chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, joining Democrats to vote in favor of it, the measure sent a clear message to President Trump that there would be serious consequences to firing the special counsel.Even senators who voted against the legislation warned Mr. Trump against trying to dismiss Mr. Mueller. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, said that \"firing Mueller would cause a firestorm and bring the administration's agenda to a halt. It could even result in impeachment.\"Mr. Trump seemingly offered fresh reason for their concern earlier on Thursday. In he again aired his frustration with the Justice Department and with Mr. Mueller's team, which he dismissed as being filled with partisan Democrats. He said he had been trying not to interfere in matters before the Justice Department.But, Mr. Trump warned, \"at some point I won't.\"Democrats have been clamoring for the Senate to move the legislation for weeks, as Mr. Trump has escalated his attacks on the special counsel investigation and contemplated removing key figures overseeing it. They claimed Thursday's vote as a modest, if mostly symbolic, victory.\"Frankly, I've never been so concerned that the walls protecting the independence and integrity of our law enforcement institutions are at risk of crumbling,\" said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the longest-serving member of the Senate. \"I'm hoping that the strong bipartisan stance we are taking today may save us from waking up to a tweetstorm that sends us careening toward a constitutional crisis.\"Republicans who support the measure have been careful to present it as a necessary and appropriate check on the authority of the presidency itself, whoever is in office.\"It's not about Mr. Mueller,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of the bill's authors. \"It's not about Trump. It's about the rule of law.\"The bill, called the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, would codify into law the existing Justice Department regulation that says a special counsel may be fired only by the attorney general, and only for good cause.It would create a 10-day window within which a special counsel could petition a panel of judges to determine if the firing was for good cause. If it were judged not to have been, the counsel would be reinstated. The bill would ensure that the special counsel's staff and investigative materials would be preserved in the interim.The senators also voted to include that would require special counsels to produce to the attorney general and to Congress a report at the end of their investigation or in the event that they are fired. Such a report would include significant findings of the case, as well as information about decisions to file charges or not to file charges, among other details. Currently, special counsels like Mr. Mueller to the attorney general, but that information will not necessarily be shared with Congress or the public.The committee voted to reject another amendment that would have replaced the bill with a nonbinding resolution saying it was the sense of the Senate that Mr. Mueller should be allowed to finish his work.Several Republican senators raised concerns about the bill's constitutionality and the ability of Congress to shield a special prosecutor from being fired by the attorney general at the president's direction.Congress, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, created the position of an independent counsel who answered to a panel of judges, not to the attorney general. The Supreme Court upheld that arrangement in 1988. But after the Iran-contra and Whitewater investigations, both parties came to view the position as far too powerful, and Congress let the independent counsel statute lapse in 1999.Mr. Grassley said he shared some of the constitutional concerns, but gave the bill his stamp of approval anyway.\"It's possible the bill goes too far, and I understand the position of those with strong constitutional objections who will vote against it,\" Mr. Grassley said ahead of the vote on Thursday. \"But, at the very least, if my amendment is adopted, it will require the executive branch to give more information to Congress.\"Republican and Democratic senators first introduced bills aimed at protecting Mr. Mueller late last summer. not long after. But an effort to combine two competing and bipartisan bills languished for months, as the urgency among Republicans dissipated.That changed with Mr. Trump's recent combativeness toward investigators, and four senators -- Mr. Graham and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, both Republicans, and Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both Democrats -- reached a compromise this month.Mr. McConnell remains opposed to the legislation, which he says would split Senate Republicans and could goad Mr. Trump into retaliating. Speaker Paul D. Ryan has offered no more support for parallel legislation in the House. And Mr. Trump would most likely veto the bill if it got to his desk.Still, Democrats, led by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, urged Mr. McConnell to change his mind and put the bill up for a vote immediately.\"Rather than waiting for a constitutional crisis, the full Senate should act now,\" he said."},

Yes, Sometimes", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/health/serial-killers-golden-state.html", "contents": "The Golden State Killer's barrage of rapes and murders began in a gold mining area east of Sacramento in 1976. By 1986, it seemed to have stopped.Why?With the of Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, who has been charged so far with eight counts of murder, more than 30 years had passed since the last episode in the series. That long period of quiescence seems to fly in the face of the popular belief that serial rapists and killers are incapable of stopping.But forensic psychiatrists, criminal profilers and homicide detectives who pursue cold cases say that assumption is more myth than reality.\"These are not acts that a person is compelled to do,\" said , a forensic psychologist and professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego. \"They are intentional and predatory. There is choice, capacity and opportunity that is exercised.\"Any number of factors can contribute to a dormant stretch. An extensive on serial murder for the F.B.I.'s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime found that killers may quiet down when they find other outlets for their emotions. The study mentioned Dennis Rader, known as the BTK Killer, who murdered 10 people from 1974 to 1991, but had no other victims before being apprehended in 2005. \"During interviews conducted by law enforcement, Rader admitted to engaging in autoerotic activities as a substitute for his killings,\" the report said.Other killers might have changed behavior after moving away from the original epicenter of activity. Ted Bundy mutilated and murdered perhaps more than 30 young women in the 1970s. Yet there were stretches along his peripatetic travels when he was not associated with murders in those areas.In some cases, jobs and families might have stabilized and exacerbating sources of stress might have faded, some experts said., a professor of forensic psychiatry at Columbia University who has extensively studied serial killers, noted that Gary Ridgeway, the Green River Killer, murdered prostitutes during his first two difficult marriages. He married a third time, more happily, and the killings dwindled.\"Some of these men have little oases of compassion, within the vast desert of their contempt and hatred of women,\" Dr. Stone said.So far, the authorities have not offered any public explanation as to why the Golden State Killer spree, for which Mr. DeAngelo was arrested this week, began and continued, much less stopped. But some experts point to the most banal explanation: In 1986, when he was 40, Mr. DeAngelo may have aged out.\"The testosterone levels are down,\" Dr. Stone said. \"His capacity to perform is weakened,\" he added, noting that he was merely speculating. The prey drive is lessened., a retired F.B.I. criminal profiler and consultant to crime shows like \"Bones\" and \"The Blacklist,\" recently worked on a study with academic researchers about older sexual homicide offenders. \"They are really rare over age 50,\" he said. \"We just don't see them. Pedophiles over 50, yes. But not rape-murderers.\"There is little research on why spree killers desist for reasons other than getting caught. No one knows what has happened to a serial killer of young women on Long Island.\"There has never been a survey of serial killers asking them why they stopped,\" said Eric Witzig, a retired homicide detective and chairman of the , a database of unsolved murders. \"All we have are anecdotal hunches,\" he said.Perhaps a victim struggled and spooked the attacker, he said. The killer \"might think then, 'Maybe I don't want to do this anymore because I might get caught.' Or, 'I want to stop and reflect on the carnage I wreaked in the past.'\"Or, said Dr. Bruce E. Harry, a retired forensic psychiatrist with the University of Missouri medical school: \"Maybe they get tired or bored and just don't want to do it anymore.\"Mr. Safarik, the retired F.B.I. crime profiler, was a beat cop in the late 1970s in Davis, Calif. and remembers being on stakeouts for the Golden State Killer, watching with night surveillance scopes for a man scrambling over rooftops or escaping into nearby fields.Then as now, police believed that the suspect had military or law enforcement training, which helped him evade detection. One reason the rapist-murderer may have stopped in the late 80s, speculated Mr. Safarik, is that he was becoming aware of the ability to collect DNA evidence, left by the most meager material. The public was becoming familiar with it, he said, particularly through television dramas.Several experts, underlining the notion that so little is yet known about Mr. DeAngelo -- including most significantly whether he committed the crimes -- wondered whether the criminal behavior did stop entirely in 1986.\"I would want to look at other rapes and murders in the areas where he lived over time,\" Dr. Meloy said. \"I would be skeptical that there was a complete shutdown at age 40.\""},

Now he is doing the same with profit.The company, which once seemed to have only a passing interest in turning a profit, said its net income for the first quarter more than doubled. Although Amazon is best known as an internet shopping destination, its cloud computing and advertising businesses were big contributors to the jump in profit.Mr. Bezos singled out the performance of the company's cloud computing business -- known as Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. -- referring in a statement to a \"remarkable acceleration\" in growth in the segment for a second consecutive quarter.Amazon often boasts of its commitment to lowering prices -- part of the reason its profits have been so limited until now -- but on Thursday it announced a price hike for one of its most important offerings. The company said it was raising the price of its Prime membership service 20 percent, to $119 from $99. Prime memberships include two-day shipping at no extra cost, a video streaming service and other benefits.Amazon's shares surged 7 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the quarterly news.The company reported that its net income for the first quarter, which ended March 31, was $1.63 billion, or $3.27 per share, compared with net income of $724 million, or $1.48 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, up from $35.7 billion a year earlier.The average estimate of financial analysts, compiled by Thomson Reuters, was for revenue of $49.87 billion and earnings of $1.27 a share.\"This was an unusually strong quarter for Amazon, where results came in both better for revenue and profits across the board,\" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Like Facebook, which has faced a grilling in Congress over its data protection practices, Amazon has faced criticism in Washington. President Trump has regularly slammed the company, saying it was killing jobs and not collecting enough taxes.But as with Facebook's users, Amazon's customers have apparently not been swayed by criticism of politicians, though many of Mr. Trump's attacks happened after the end of the quarter.Amazon's revenue received a big lift from the company's acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year. The company's physical stores business, most of which is from Whole Foods, added $4.26 billion in revenue for the quarter.Revenue from A.W.S., meanwhile, rose 49 percent to $5.44 billion from the same period a year earlier.That increase is larger that what the A.W.S. business was seeing just a few quarters ago. It is unusual to see revenue growth increase significantly at Amazon's size and in a hypercompetitive market, and it seems to have prompted Mr. Bezos to single out the business in his statement.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said, \"That's rare to see him say something like that.\"The increase in the cost of Prime memberships came shortly after Mr. Bezos announced, in the company's annual shareholder letter, that Amazon had more than 100 million Prime subscribers globally. During the first quarter, revenue from subscription services, including Prime, jumped 60 percent to $3.1 billion.Amazon said the price on Prime will go up on May 11 for new members, and starting June 16 for renewals of membership for existing members. The company said the increase, the first for its annual plan in four years, was the result of significantly increased costs for the service.Those include the billions of dollars that Amazon has poured into financing new television shows and movies which have been added to its video streaming service. On Thursday, it announced with the National Football League a renewed agreement for Amazon to exclusively stream Thursday night football games to Prime subscribers.In a call with financial analysts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said that four years ago, Prime members could receive free two-day shipping on about 20 million products from Amazon. Now that figure is 100 million.\"There's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program,\" Mr. Olsavsky said. \"It's much different than it was in 2014.\""},

She knew she would wait hours to be processed, go through several metal detectors and be subjected to a search by dogs sniffing for drugs and weapons.But she never thought she would be standing naked and in tears before two New York City Department of Correction officers as they checked her body cavities for contraband.On the Oct. 2, 2015, visit, Ms. Reynoso said she passed through three metal detectors, including at the George Motchan Detention Center, one of 10 jails on Rikers Island. While she was waiting to see her husband, a female officer ordered her to disrobe in a small, cold search room. When she asked why, she said the officer threatened to cancel her visits for 45 days.She said she signed a form consenting to a pat frisk, a search that typically includes removal of outerwear like a coat, hat and shoes. Instead, Ms. Reynoso was told to take off all her clothing, according to an account she provided in an interview and in a lawsuit she filed in 2016.According to the lawsuit, the female correction officer ran her hands over Ms. Reynoso's breasts and genitalia, asked her to squat and violently inserted two fingers into her anus. She said she was menstruating at the time of the visit. \"They didn't care,\" Ms. Reynoso said. \"They wanted to see if drugs would fall out from my clothes.\"Ms. Reynoso is one of seven women interviewed by The New York Times who have filed lawsuits or notices of claim against the city alleging illegal searches conducted in violation of city policy. A review of these lawsuits and more than two dozen other court cases filed by visitors point to a similar pattern: The visitors said they signed a waiver for a routine pat-down, but instead, they said, they were taken to search rooms or bathrooms for full strip searches, some involving invasive cavity checks. The prevalence of strip searches of visitors in the city's jails, as detailed in lawsuits, was first reported last year in a joint investigation by .The search Ms. Reynoso described is prohibited in city jails. In and prisons, strip searches of visitors are permitted with consent, but not cavity checks. In city jails, however, neither strip searches nor cavity checks of visitors are allowed, Department of Correction officials said.\"There's no reason for it, no justification for a cavity search, period,\" said Martin Horn, who ran the city's correction department from 2003 to 2009 and is now a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"I can't be anymore emphatic than that.\"Yet allegations of inappropriate searches of visitors are common enough to have prompted separate investigations by the Bronx district attorney's office and the New York City Department of Investigation during the last two years. Neither resulted in criminal charges.Elias Husamudeen, the president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, scoffed at the claims raised by the women in the lawsuits and said he has seen no evidence of officers conducting inappropriate searches of visitors.\"People are coming in with weapons in their vaginas, up their anus and in baby bottles,\" Mr. Husamudeen said. \"I've had to call child welfare to come and get kids and I've had to arrest a grandma who didn't know she was being used to bring drugs to jail. This is the reality of jail.\"A culture of violence and corruption has plagued the city's jails. At Rikers, the prevalence of smuggled drugs and weapons is a key factor in the city's plan to close it down completely within 10 years.To increase safety, the correction department has stepped up the number of visitor searches over the last four years.Still, most visitors present no security threat.Last year, of the more than 247,340 visitors to the city's 14 jails, fewer than 0.1 percent -- 305 people -- were charged with smuggling in contraband.For families with relatives in jail, visits are an essential link in the uphill effort to maintain strong connections. But trips can be a traumatizing and deeply humiliating experience, some visitors said, pointing to searches, long wait times and inhospitable correction officers.In 2016, 31 percent of the 199 complaints that visitors lodged against correction officers were for improper searches and sexual misconduct, according to data provided by the correction department. In 2017, 18 percent of the 245 complaints were for inappropriate searches and sexual misconduct.The current head of the correction department, Cynthia Brann, said efforts are underway to make the visitation process better.\"We know it's important to help people in custody maintain strong connections to family and community and have worked hard to improve the visit process under this administration,\" Ms. Brann said in a statement. \"We know additional work is needed and we are determined to build on our progress, while also balancing the need to increase safety by reducing the flow of contraband into the jails.\"In 2016, the department installed cameras in jail search areas, but complaints about inappropriate searches continued. That year, Raymond Audain, senior counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of four women who said they were improperly searched at Rikers Island. Alan Figman, a lawyer, represents Ms. Reynoso and at least 30 other women and one man who have alleged improper searches.\"It's a systemic design to put these women down,\" Mr. Figman said.Ms. Reynoso, 28, said the experience left her with deep emotional wounds.\"The way they treat you is bad,\" Ms. Reynoso said. \"That's the price you got to pay for having a family member that's incarcerated.\"Last year, the correction department's own investigation division found one officer had conducted an improper search. That officer was placed on probation, officials said.The head of the city's independent Department of Investigation, Mark G. Peters, said his office analyzed surveillance videos in 2016 and interviewed 30 of the visitors who said they were improperly searched.Pursuing a criminal complaint against specific officers proved difficult, he said, because there were no witnesses or video confirmation.For similar reasons, the investigation by the Bronx district attorney's office did not lead to criminal charges said Patrice O'Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the office.Mr. Peters's investigation led him to write to , then the correction department's commissioner, urging him to take several steps, including issuing a directive that specifically prohibits cavity searches, better training about permitted searches and requiring that all pat frisks be conducted in public.In some instances multiple complaints have been lodged against the same officer. The officer named in Ms. Reynoso's complaint was accused of conducting or supervising improper searches of at least three other visitors, including Tamara Blackwood.Ms. Blackwood said she questioned an officer before she was searched during a 2015 visit to Rikers Island. She said the officer told her, \"'You can't tell me what to do on my island. Once you cross that bridge and sign these papers you're subjected to anything we want to do.'\"Ms. Blackwood, who filed a lawsuit in 2015, said the officer threatened to detain her for the weekend if she continued to protest.During a strip search, the officer swiped her gloved hand across her vagina and buttocks and told her to cough, she said.She said she was strip-searched on two prior visits but was unaware the procedure was prohibited. Until the more invasive search occurred, Ms. Blackwood said she did not believe stories she had heard other women tell.\"I didn't take it as truth,\" she said. \"Sometimes you think it's an exaggeration, and that they don't just do it just to do it.\"The lawsuits offer several theories about what might trigger such searches.Cristina Mateo, 28, said a female guard indicated she had smelled marijuana during her 2016 visit to the Brooklyn Detention Center.Ms. Mateo recounted in an interview and detailed in a lawsuit that the officer ordered her to strip and inserted two fingers into her vagina. The officer did not find drugs, and Ms. Mateo was permitted to visit her boyfriend, she said. The ordeal frightened her then 4-year-old daughter, who witnessed the search, she said.In other cases, inmates appeared to have been flagged. Two women -- Michelle Gumbs, who visited her fiance on Rikers Island in 2015, and Monica Salaman, who visited her brother at the Brooklyn Detention Complex in 2016 -- said in separate lawsuits filed against the city that correction officers explained that they had to be strip-searched because the inmate was \"on a list that required all visitors of the named inmates be searched.\"A correction officer who previously worked at the visiting center at Rikers Island, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the officer is not authorized to speak to the media, said some female officers conducted strip searches and body-cavity searches if they believed a visitor was concealing contraband or if the visitor was flagged during a canine search. Supervisors, the correction officer said, would give them \"the green light to do what they got to do.\"The city has come under fire in the past for its use of strip searches on suspects who were awaiting arraignment as well as detainees accused of minor offenses -- practices that also are banned. In 2010, it to about 100,000 people after correction officers were accused of strip-searching suspects charged with misdemeanors. And in 2001, the city shelled out $40 million to settle a case in which 50,000 people were strip-searched while waiting to be arraigned.But when it comes to visitors, Mr. Horn, the former head of the city jail system, said there are at least three alternatives to invasive searches: deny the visit; conduct a pat frisk; or keep the visitor and the inmate separated by a glass partition.The city has made efforts to crack down on smuggling and reduce attacks on officers and inmates at Rikers. In 2016, the department added canine teams and created a bus amnesty program, which allows visitors taking the Q100 bus to Rikers to leave weapons or drugs behind with no penalty. Last year, 553 weapons were recovered at city correction facilities, up from 88 in 2014, according to data provided by the Department of Correction. Last year, officers found illegal drugs 760 times, up from 272 in 2014.Mr. Peters has said rogue correction employees are responsible for ferrying a large share of the contraband that infiltrates jails.In 2014, a D.O.I. inspector posed as a correction officer and was able to past six different employee security screenings at Rikers. The agency launched a similar investigation last year at detention facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn and concluded that the department was failing to properly screen its employees at those sites.Since 2010, 27 employees have been accused of smuggling contraband into the jails, according to the D.O.I.\"If you want to maintain safe, non-chaotic jails you have to check the correction officers,\" Mr. Peters said. \"The biggest issue isn't visitors, but the correction officers -- because they can bring in large amounts of contraband.\""},

Draft 2018: Analysis of All 32 Picks in Round 1", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/sports/nfl-draft.html", "contents": "The first round of the 2018 N.F.L. draft was loaded with quarterbacks, so it was no surprise they dominated the night. The only surprising thing was the order in which they were taken.Cleveland bet big on Oklahoma's , and that started a run that saw four quarterbacks go in the first ten picks for the first time in the N.F.L.'s common draft era. Mayfield was hardly a consensus top choice, and the pick comes with some unintended baggage thanks to the young quarterback's similarities to Johnny Manziel, who flamed out in Cleveland. But the Browns' front office preferred him to Southern California's Sam Darnold (No. 3, Jets), Wyoming's Josh Allen (No. 7, Bills) and U.C.L.A.'s Josh Rosen (No. 10, Cardinals). Fittingly the round was bookended with Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks, as Mayfield, the 2017 winner, went No. 1, and Louisville's Lamar Jackson, the 2016 winner, went No. 32.The day also included the first ever pair of brothers to be first-rounders in the same year, with Virginia Tech sending Tremaine Edmunds to Buffalo at No. 16 and Terrell Edmunds to Pittsburgh at No. 28.The draft will continue with rounds two and three on Friday night, with plenty of impact players like Iowa's Josh Jackson, Louisiana State's Derrius Guice and Southern Methodist's Courtland Sutton still on the board.Here's an analysis of all 32 picks in the first round:Is Mayfield essentially Johnny Manziel without as much baggage? That's the big question for the Sooners quarterback who used his supercharged attitude and athleticism to find a great deal of success despite being on the smaller side (6 foot 1, 215 pounds). Like Manziel did in college, Mayfield has an innate ability to rally his teammates around him, he reacts well to the play unfolding in front of him and has more of an arm than some might guess. The questions for him revolve mostly around his ability to use his emotions at the pro level without having them consume him. Also, some doubt that his deep passes, which tend to hang a bit, will be as effective as they were against the less sophisticated defensive backs he faced in college. Cleveland has needed a quarterback since it came back into the N.F.L. in 1999. They must believe that the similarities between Mayfield and Manziel are only superficial, and they were willing to bet big on that fact. He has a little time to develop with Tyrod Taylor in town and Browns fans will have to hope that they've finally found the quarterback to solve what has seemed like an endless deficiency.---If Leonard Fournette owed Ezekiel Elliott a thank you card for going with the No. 4 pick last year, then Saquon Barkley should send both of them a gift basket. Drafting running backs at the top of the first round is cool again, and that is great timing for Barkley, who has the potential to be a special player at the pro level. Barkley runs a 4.4 40-yard dash, has a 41-inch vertical leap and did 29 reps on the bench press at the combine. Elliott didn't participate in the bench press but was worse in the 40 (4.47 seconds) and in the leap (32.5 inches). The physical gifts were turned into production in college, with Barkley rushing for 3,843 yards and 43 touchdowns in his three years at Penn State, and developing into a solid pass-catching option out of the backfield as a junior. He does not break many tackles, and may take some time to learn pass-protection, but there is little doubt that he can be a star. Even with quarterback Eli Manning's future in doubt, the Giants made the wise decision to take the best player in the draft. The three top quarterbacks available are all talented but also have some question marks about how good they will be. Almost no one doubts that Barkley will be an immediate superstar.Darnold is the happy medium of the first-round quarterback options. At 6-foot-3 and 221 pounds he is not quite as big as Josh Allen but he has a more typical pro build than Baker Mayfield. He has the arm to make any throw and has shown decent accuracy as well, while being far more mobile than you might guess. His 40-yard dash time of 4.85 seconds was just one-hundredth of a second slower than Mayfield and wasn't enough slower than Allen's 4.75 for that to tip the scales in Allen's favor. The biggest drawback with Darnold, beyond a troubling propensity for turnovers, is a slow and deliberate release that could be a major issue in the N.F.L. The Jets' biggest needs were at quarterback, cornerback and edge rusher. Josh McCown can hold down the fort at quarterback for the time being and Teddy Bridgewater has a ton of potential (and a ton of risk) as a backup, but Darnold is too talented to pass up. He could easily take over the starting job this season but he has the luxury of not having to if his development goes slowly.Ward is fast. Really fast. His 4.32-second 40 tied for the fastest mark among defensive backs at the combine and he used that speed, along with strong instincts in man coverage, to find consistent success at the college level. He did not generate many turnovers, with just two interceptions over three seasons, but he broke up 15 passes as a junior thanks to his ability to read plays. On intelligence and speed he should step in as a starter-level player immediately, with the main concern for him being his size. At 5-foot-11 and 183 pounds, he is far smaller than the receivers he will be asked to cover, and even with a 39-inch vertical leap he could be prone to losing battles for passes thrown above the shoulder level. He could also potentially be a liability in terms of tackling, though plenty of poor-tackling cornerbacks have proven their worth in the past. With the quarterback situation settled (the Browns hope), Cleveland took a risk by skipping over Bradley Chubb and going with Ward, the best defensive back in the draft. The Browns have Myles Garrett on the defensive line already, so they may have just wanted to get an elite talent on another level of their defense, but Ward presents at least slightly more risk than Chubb.Chubb won both the Hendricks and Bronko Nagurski awards as the nation's top defensive end and top overall defender thanks to his 10 sacks and 23 tackles for a loss. The numbers were impressive, but even more so because they were nearly carbon copies to what he'd done as a junior in 2016, when he had 10 sacks and 21 tackles for a loss. With a 4.65-second 40-yard dash he is among the fastest defensive linemen in the draft, but he matches that with a rangy (for his position) build of 6-foot-4 and 270 pounds. He has found success both outrunning offensive linemen and also running through them. His game could still use some pro refinement, but he has relatively few question marks for his ability to be an immediate impact player. Everyone expected the Broncos to take a quarterback but the team decided to reload its strength on defense by taking the best defensive player in this draft. Chubb doesn't necessarily fill a need, but the prospect of he and Von Miller terrorizing quarterbacks makes the team's struggles on offense at least somewhat less of an issue. They still badly need a quarterback, however.Offensive tackles have finally begun to be appreciated by a widespread audience, but guards still tend to be overlooked, which is why Nelson's status near the top of most draft boards makes him stand out so much. At 6-foot-5 and 325 pounds he is built like a tackle, and he uses his off-the-charts power to move through a defense in a way that has inspired comparisons to Larry Allen. Only 11 guards have ever been selected in the first five picks of the draft (none since 1985), and the only one since 1988 to crack the top-nine was Jonathan Cooper who went to Arizona at No. 7 in 2013. But Nelson's size, strength and technique make him perhaps this draft's most can't-miss talent. Colts running backs are popping bottles of champagne. Nelson is a wrecking ball and he is the type of offensive line prospect who can single-handedly make the team dangerous. It's unusual for a guard to go this high in the draft but Nelson will instantly make their team better. He was the top offensive line prospect in the draft by a mile and the Colts, a team that theoretically doesn't need a quarterback, recognized that he was too good to pass up.The first trade of the draft. The Bills gave up the No. 12 pick and two second rounders for a chance at Allen, who is easily the most divisive of the elite quarterback prospects (and no, it's not because of a few dumb tweets he sent while he was in high school). He's big (6-foot-5, 237 pounds), he's fast enough to be considered mobile (4.75-second 40) and he's got arm strength to spare. But he developed late, which led to very little recruitment coming out of high school, and he has yet to show an ability to have the accuracy necessary to succeed in the N.F.L. The combination of a lack of ability to throw on the run, a tendency to make poor decisions, and a sense that he does not necessarily have much control of where the ball ends up leaves him as a quarterback who can look elite on one play and inept on the next. If it is simply a matter of him still learning the game, then he could develop into something special, but there is a tremendous bust risk in picking him high in the draft.In an interview broadcast on ESPN, Allen addressed the Bills trading up for him despite the controversy over offensive tweets that he'd sent in high school. \"I'm going to make them look like they're the smartest people out there,\" he said. With Tyrod Taylor gone and Nathan Peterman being terrible, the Bills needed a quarterback and they got one that some people thought was the top overall player in this draft. There are certainly question marks about Allen but he's played in cold weather and he has slightly more upside than Josh Rosen, so the team is hoping they bet big and will win big.Smith is sort of the antithesis of Tremaine Edmunds. He's not nearly as large (6-foot-1, 236 pounds) and while he has elite speed there are questions about if he is strong enough to play in the middle of the field. Where he makes up for that is in natural linebacker instincts. He is a smart player, a strong leader, and is the type of guy coaches will trust to make decisions on the field. The Bears' biggest need was at linebacker and Smith fits the bill. The team is hoping he's a new version of Brian Urlacher, and the concept is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. He could be a true anchor for their defense.He is the top-rated tackle in the draft, but McGlinchey is far overshadowed by his linemate Quenton Nelson. That being said, McGlinchey brings a huge frame (6-foot-8, 309 pounds with 34-inch arms) and he is pro-ready in terms of technique and instinct. The limitations to his game all revolve around his strength and his ability to deal with power rushers. If he can add some bulk without losing his mobility, that could help alleviate the concern. McGlinchey is the second Notre Dame offensive lineman to go in the first 10 picks, and while he's not nearly the prospect that Nelson is, he's a solid tackle who can be an anchor on either side of the line for San Francisco. He now has the job of protecting Jimmy Garoppolo who went from backup in New England to face of the franchise in San Francisco in the span of five games.The second trade of the draft sent the tenth pick from Oakland to Arizona so the Cardinals could get their new franchise quarterback. They gave up three picks (15, 79 and 152) to get Rosen, who is not the kind of player who will wow anyone at a combine, but has good size (6-foot-4, 226 pounds) and a track record for the Bruins that suggests he has a deep understanding of the position even if he does not have the strongest arm or the most athleticism. His experience playing under center means there will not be much of a learning curve at the pro level, and he has shown the personality to be a strong leader off the field as well as on it.The concern with Rosen is entirely how durable he will be. His narrow frame would be a concern even without his history of injury problems so a team betting big on him has to be concerned of what that could mean for him, especially if he ends up in an environment with poor pass protection.This is the first time in the N.F.L.'s common draft era (1967 to present) where four quarterbacks were selected in the first 10 picks. While Allen and Rosen fell farther than some expected, the quarterback class has made history before any of them have thrown a pro pass. Sam Bradford is a good quarterback who has plenty of good football left to play, but his fragility is a huge concern. Getting a young player who can benefit from watching Bradford play before ultimately taking over is a solid move for the Cardinals. That being said, Rosen has an injury history as well, so the team has plenty of risk at the position even with two good quarterbacks on the roster.He was an instant success for talent-laden Alabama thanks to a nose for the ball, and that continued as he finished his three-year college career with nine interceptions, four of which he returned for touchdowns. He has played some cornerback but will probably be a safety in the N.F.L. where he will have the ability to participate in all aspects of the defense. He is a strong tackler, has great freelance instincts and, other than some questions as to his ability to handle man-to-man coverage as a corner (something he will likely not be asked to do), he should be the type of player who arrives in the pros ready to start. The Dolphins probably wanted a quarterback, but they didn't want one bad enough to trade up and Fitzpatrick is a solid pick here as a defensive back who could solidify the middle of the field for Miami. It's somewhat surprising that he went before Florida State's Derwin James, but the Dolphins may have considered him to have more upside.A mammoth tackle at 6-foot-4 and 347 pounds, Vea was already known for otherworldly strength and he proved it at the combine with 41 reps on the bench press. Despite that size and raw power, he moves remarkably well for an interior lineman. He could use some refinement to correct some issues, and may need a coach who can motivate him to break some bad habits, but physically he is ready to be an impact player from Day 1. Vea doesn't fit. He makes room for himself. The Buccaneers got an anchor for their defensive line and they were paid with two second rounders for their trouble. There were players higher on most draft boards available, so the pick is certainly a surprise, but a defense that had plenty of holes just got a giant stopper.A key playmaker in Alabama's national championship victory, Payne was a 350-pound goliath at the start of his college career but slimmed down to just over 300 while remaining just as strong. He may have to add some of that bulk back in the pros, but he has shown no ill-effects in terms of power when attacking the line of scrimmage and may just be the rare slender (slender is relative in this case) tackle, who succeeds based on top-notch run-stopping ability and excellent technique. This is the second consecutive year that the Redskins took a defensive lineman from Alabama, so they must have liked what they got in Jonathan Allen. It was almost shocking that history didn't repeat itself with the Redskins lucking into the best safety in the draft (Derwin James) like they did in 2004 (Sean Taylor) but Payne and Allen know each other well and could make defensive line a huge strength for the Redskins.The Saints paid a huge price to get Davenport. They sent Green Bay the Nos. 27 and 147 picks along with a first-rounder next year. A tall (6-foot-6) and fairly slender (264 pounds) edge rusher, Davenport has gotten steadily bigger and stronger since entering college and could presumably continue to develop, which would certainly help if a team hopes to use him as a defensive end in a 4-3 scheme. He's fast and aggressive, but his burst is somewhat lacking as are his instincts. That all adds up to him being far from a sure thing, but having the potential to be something special in the right environment. This one is a surprise. The Saints sent a nice package of picks to Green Bay to get an edge rusher who is undoubtedly a difference-maker on defense but isn't the type of guy who most draft boards had rated highly enough to warrant such an outlay. If Davenport starts piling up sacks at the pro level no one will question this pick, but any rookie struggles will be compounded by the knowledge that the team gave up next year's first-round pick as well.Miller is a giant at 6-foot-9, but he is fairly slender for a tackle at 309 pounds. While he has athleticism to spare for a player at his position, he has not quite figured out how to let his length compensate for his limitations in terms of a strong base. That will probably require an adjustment period at the pro level, but a player of his size who moves like can is such a rarity that teams will not require much convincing to be patient. The Raiders had been strong on the offensive line in recent years, but they've had some turnover and some injuries so they selected a mammoth left tackle to protect Derek Carr's blind side. It could be a few years before he's worthy of his lofty draft position, but there is reason to believe he will be there. At 6-foot-9, all Miller needs is the right coach to figure out how to best utilize his perfect size at tackle.The Bills already pulled one trade in this draft to get quarterback Josh Allen and now they've done another to get Edmunds. They gave up the Nos. 22 and 65 in exchange for the 16th pick and a fifth-rounder -- and that might be a steal for this guy. Standing 6 foot 5 inches with long arms and a fairly narrow frame, Edmunds does not look like a typical linebacker, but the son of Ferrell Edmunds, a two-time Pro Bowler at tight end, uses his size and as a huge advantage to succeed at any of the linebacker positions. There are few players to match him up with historically, but one similar player was Julian Peterson, a tall linebacker who on any given play could line up at safety, any linebacker position, or even as a defensive end. The concerns about Edmunds rest on whether he has the next-level instincts that truly great linebackers tend to possess. That will not be an issue for several years, however, as he can compensate so much athletically that he has time to learn the finer details of the game while still being a star. There was no reason for anyone to believe that Edmunds would still be available this deep in the draft, so the Bills' rebuilding process got another jolt with the selection of an absolutely huge inside linebacker who can do so many things that he can help all over the field. He might have a rough adjustment to the N.F.L., especially since he's still a teenager, but he'll get there.He only played 26 games in college, but James has the perfect size (6-foot-2, 215 pounds), strength (21 reps on the bench press) and speed (4.47 in the 40-yard dash) to be a game-changing safety. His game could use some refinement but he has continued to improve and his big personality should make him a leader on the field. Some injuries in the past, including an A.C.L. repair, should be noted, but any flaws he has on the field are correctable through coaching. It was a long wait, but James looked ecstatic to be heading to Los Angeles. He immediately strengthens the middle of the field for a defense that was strongest on the edges and the Chargers got a player who is a top-10 talent at 17.The Packers had traded down earlier in the draft, but with Alexander available they went back up in a trade with Seattle. They gave up the No. 25 pick along with picks in the third- and sixth-rounds, but they get a guy who was one of the two top cornerbacks left on the board. It is not great when you're an undersized cornerback to have spent the bulk of your junior season either out with an injury or limited by said injury. But Alexander showed enough skill in his sophomore season to make him a worthy first-round pick, even if the team selecting him feels he will need to find a permanent home as a nickel corner to help protect him. A good performance at the combine helped rescue some of the draft stock that had tanked based on his lost 2017 season. The Packers' secondary was a huge liability last year so they tried to address that need with a player who carries a solid amount of risk but understands the position well and could be a top cornerback if things go right. He's also a talented punt returner, something the Packers need. He's certainly exciting and Green Bay just has to hope he can turn that outsized attitude into a consistent career.A 6-foot-4, 256-pound linebacker with a nose for the ball, Vander Esch is an athletic freak who developed into a pro prospect in college after not having made much noise in high school. He looks and plays like a former basketball player, and has shown an ability to make tough tackles, but there is a sense that he is still learning the game after just one year as a starter in college. The Cowboys needed more defense and they are hoping Vander Esch can be a diamond in the rough. It must have killed Jerry Jones to not take a player more worthy of headlines (like Alabama's Calvin Ridley) but Vander Esch might be the smarter pick. There is some bust potential, however, if he plateaus in development.It didn't involve a first-round pick but the Oakland Raiders made one of the biggest moves of the day by trading a third-rounder (No. 79) for Pittsburgh's Martavis Bryant. A big-play wide receiver who stands 6 feet 4 inches, Bryant has at times looked like an emerging superstar but he had off-field problems lead to him missing a season with a suspension and once he came back the team never seemed to warm back up to him. A new start with Derek Carr throwing to him in Oakland could be huge for both him and the Raiders.Ragnow wasn't on many draft boards at the start of this year's draft process, but he rose quickly as people took a closer look at his film and his combine results. At 6-foot-5 and 325 pounds, he is enormous for a center, and he plays the game with a physical style that is what a lot of teams hope for at the position. He's not a top-tier athlete, and may struggle with faster players, but he will fall back on a big personality and a solid amount of coachability to get where he needs to be. This is a bit of a reach at 20, with plenty of players left on the board with better pedigrees, but the Lions must have fallen in love with the thought of him at center, and they figured he would not be there when they pick again at 51.Price can play guard and center, but doesn't play a particularly disciplined game, and sometimes borders on too intense. He will need to find a way to channel that energy in a more efficient manner, especially in a league where he does not have the same amount of physical advantage. He is one of the strongest players in the draft and he likes to show that early and often. Like the Lions, the Bengals had a need so they reached to get a center. The good news is that Price was ranked ahead of Frank Ragnow on most draft lists, so their reach was slightly less ... reachy, than Detroit's.The Titans gave up the Nos. 25 and 125 picks to get Nos. 22 and 215. They did so to get Evans, the Alabama linebacker du jour. Stuck behind a host of talented players in his first few years with the Crimson Tide, Evans finally got his chance as a senior and, as many expected, he thrived. While he did not run the 40 as the combine, it's believed he has the speed to be an elite inside linebacker in 3-4 offense and has displayed a willingness to work on his game that will be music to a his new coaches' ears. The Titans probably needed an edge rusher more than an inside linebacker, but Evans is a tremendous value pick at 22 and the price they paid in trade was not too extreme. Tennessee Coach Mike Vrabel, who played for the Patriots, undoubtedly was attracted to someone who could play several different positions on defense. If Evans had lasted another pick he almost certainly would have gone to New England.There is some debate about whether Wynn is a guard or a tackle, but the 6-foot-3 313-pounder is certainly a prospect who could mold into a quality player at either position. He is both fast and agile for a player of his size and the reason for the ambiguity about his position is because he has shown such a strong ability in pass protection to go with his top-tier run-blocking. He just has to prove he's strong enough. The Patriots, unsurprisingly, took a player who is pretty clearly a prospect and they will work out where he plays later. He can either add bulk and stay at guard or refine his technique and play tackle. Considering Bill Belichick is his coach, he might just be asked to do both.He plays the game somewhat similar to another former Terrapin, Stefon Diggs, but Moore is slightly larger. His speed (4.42 in the 40) and his leaping ability (39.5 inches) will be huge assets, and he really blossomed in terms of production as a junior, which is a trend teams will hope continues as he makes the leap to the pros. He needs to work on routes, and to figure out how to win battles for the ball with cornerbacks, but the raw tools are there. Calvin Ridley would probably like to have a word with the Panthers about how he was not the first wide receiver off the board, but Moore had incredible combine numbers. If he can clean up his game and learn to make the most of his physical ability, he could be a huge complement to the Panthers' offense with Cam Newton throwing and Christian McCaffrey making plays all over the field.A two-sport athlete, Hurst was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2012 as a pitcher. In a sign of true versatility, he was a pitcher, converted to an infielder, and now he's a first-round pick as a tight end in the N.F.L. That path puts him on the older side at 24, but he has the size and strength to succeed as a tight end, and he plays the game with an almost reckless attitude that has served him well. He may need to work on disguising his routes more, but that could come with more coaching. The last first-round pick of Ozzie Newsome's legendary career as an executive was a tight end, which seems just about perfect. They call him Garnet Thor, and he's taken an odd path to the N.F.L., but Hurst is not a gimmick. There is not an endorsement for a tight end much stronger than Newsome, a Hall of Fame tight end, picking you in the first round.Ridley's overall college statistics did not really live up to the potential he showed as a freshman in 2015 when he had 89 receptions for 1,045 yards, but he finished his three-year career at Alabama with 19 touchdowns. While he's not exactly ideal size for a wideout (6-foot-1, 189 pounds), he has 4.43 speed in the 40 and is known for running exceptional routes. He had more drops than you would expect from a player who seems so otherwise refined in technique, but some of that might be a result of his anticipation of hits, which could become more pronounced in the N.F.L. where he will regularly face defensive backs that are far bigger and stronger than he is. Putting Ridley on the field with fellow Alabama alum Julio Jones could not be more perfect. Talent evaluators think the N.F.L. game will unlock the potential in Ridley, which could make this pick one of the best in terms of value in the entire draft. It is hard to think of a better role model for him than Jones, even if Ridley cannot match his new teammate's physical stature.Penny is a fast (4.46 in the 40) back who is decently sized (5-foot-11, 220 pounds). He's an old-fashioned volume guy at running back who just tries to wear defenses down and breaks more than a few tackles. He doesn't always make the right lane decisions, though, and tacklers with better technique tended to catch him easily and bring him down. The Seahawks' offense was completely one-dimensional last season so they desperately needed a running back. That being said, Louisiana State's Derrius Guice and Georgia's Sony Michel would have been far more logical picks than Penny, who doesn't profile as a star at the N.F.L. level. Maybe Seattle knows something no one else knows about him.His brother already went with the No. 16 pick, and now it's Terrell's turn. He's far smaller than Tremaine but he can play near the line of scrimmage and deliver big hits, but is not lost in man-to-man coverage. He needs to get more consistent in tackling, and occasionally has mental lapses, but he has the talent to thrive. Edmunds's selection became somewhat secondary after Ryan Shazier, the Pittsburgh linebacker who endured a horrific spine injury in Week 13, walked onto the stage to introduce the pick. It was an incredible moment, with Shazier being assisted on his way out but standing on his own at the podium. Make no mistake: Edmunds is the type of player who could be a strong fit in Pittsburgh's system. This is the first time brothers have been taken in the first round in the same year.He has a lot to learn about the position, and it's a total unknown if he can develop the instincts necessary to thrive, but he is a risk worth taking with the reward being a 6-foot-5, 291-pound hard-worker who could theoretically play anywhere on the defensive line. It is a leap of faith, though, as he has never produced much statistically and there is a chance that he is a tackle in an end's body. There will never be enough top-notch defenders for Jacksonville. They already had a defense that gave every opposing team nightmares and now they've added the son of a Navy Seal who can wreak havoc in the middle of the field.He does not have a ton of experience at the position and he does not have ideal size or speed, but Hughes has made teams interested by showing strong physicality, tracking the ball well in the air and having good hands when he has the opportunity to snatch a pass away from a receiver. He needs work as a tackler, and will get bullied by larger players, but the team the Vikings might be just as interested in him as a return specialist as they are in his ability to be a defensive back. He's had a whole host of off-the-field issues which caused his stock to drop. The Vikings hope they've done their due diligence to evaluate whether his problems are behind him, but the 49ers thought they had a steal last year in Reuben Foster only for that young linebacker's troubles to continue to affect his career. If Hughes can keep himself on the field, he could be an injection of youth for a Minnesota secondary that has a ton of talent but is getting long in the tooth.Anyone who watched the Rose Bowl is probably wondering why Michel was not off the board earlier. The Georgia running back absolutely torched Oklahoma. But while he's a strong runner for his size, he does not, at this point, make the sharp cuts that are expected in the N.F.L. and there is a belief that he was somewhat of a product of Georgia's excellent blocking scheme. The big play potential is there, though, so the Patriots must believe they can refine his game into something special. New England went with a pair of players from Georgia with their two first-round picks, and while Michel showed off some serious explosiveness in his final year with the Bulldogs, he might be a mild reach ahead of Derrius Guice. This is the Patriots, though, so they undoubtedly have a plan to unlock Michel's talents in a way that no one else has thought of yet.Baltimore executed a trade with Philadelphia so they could take Jackson. While Josh Allen may have a lot of questions about how he can succeed at quarterback in the N.F.L., Jackson faces one with even bigger consequences for player and team: Is he a quarterback?It is interesting that his accuracy as a thrower is often seen as a non-starter despite his completion percentage in college being higher than Allen's, but it is likely a combination of that and his size (6-foot-2, 216 pounds) that has people wondering if his athleticism would translate better at wide receiver. The best bet with Jackson may be to forget the concept of position and simply consider him a football player. Someone with his speed, agility, and throwing ability could certainly help a team with a creative offensive coordinator provided he is willing to open his mind to possibilities that don't necessarily have him under center on every down.According to ESPN's Field Yates, the Ravens traded the Nos. 52 and 125 picks along with a 2019 second-rounder for the Nos. 32 and 132 picks. It takes away some of the poetry of Ozzie Newsome taking a tight end with his final first-round pick, but this pick shows off Newsome's willingness to take big risks. Jackson's value to the Ravens won't be known for some time, but there's no reason he couldn't participate in the offense in a wildcat formation along with Joe Flacco, not unlike Colin Kaepernick did in his early days with the 49ers and Alex Smith. That could give him a soft entry as a passer so he can convince the doubters that he is what he says he is."},

{"author": "JAMIE LINCOLN KITMAN", "title": "'In Italy, There Was the Pope and Then There Was Enzo Ferrari'", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/books/book-enzo-ferrari-car-luca-dal-monte.html", "contents": "WHITE PLAINS -- Luca Dal Monte is eyeing the 1966 Ferrari 275 GTB sitting on the shop floor here at Dominick's European Car Repair. He has traveled from his home in Milan to promote his latest book, a biography of the car's namesake, Enzo Ferrari.The 954-page scholarly tome (over 1,000 pages in Italian) has received rave reviews in Italy since it came out in 2016, and has been optioned for an Italian mini-series. (According to Il Giornale, an Italian-language newspaper based in Milan, the book reads like a novel.) David Bull Publishing recently released an English-language version of the book -- \"Enzo Ferrari: Power, Politics and the Making of an Automotive Empire\" -- in the United States.Mr. Dal Monte, an American-ophile who was the head of Ferrari's North American press office from 2001 to 2005, wrote the book in Italian and translated it himself into English for an American audience. He met me here at this mecca for Italian cars and their admirers, outside New York City. We're going for a spirited drive through Westchester County in the limited production 12-cylinder automobile that he's presently admiring.The steel gray coupe is a fitting emblem with which to remember Ferrari the man, along with the business he founded almost 70 years ago. Like most Ferraris, the car is stunning and not cheap: It more than 50 years ago -- about the most you could spend on a car at that time -- and might bring were it for sale, underscoring one reason Ferrari has been called .The company's success owes everything to its founder, who was born in 1898, and had little formal education. He was inspired to become a racecar driver after seeing Felice Nazzaro win the 1908 Circuito di Bologna. But it wasn't until after World War II, at the age of 49, that he created his legendary car company.Ferrari is often remembered solely as cold and calculating, with his trademark trench coat and dark sunglasses. But Mr. Dal Monte wants readers to see the genius that Ferrari possessed. Yes, he was stubborn, but he was driven and determined to be successful. He used his charm and intelligence to get others to invest in him, said Mr. Dal Monte, who saw these qualities in Ferrari's personal correspondence and his relationship with his sons, Alfredo \"Dino,\" who died in 1956 at the age of 24 from muscular dystrophy, and Piero, who was born out of wedlock to Ferrari's longtime mistress, Lina Lardi. (Ferrari's wife, Laura, suffered severe depression her entire life, and though he had affairs with other women, they remained married until she died in 1978. Ferrari never remarried and died in 1988.)\"In Italy, there was the pope and then there was Enzo,\" Mr. Dal Monte said as we drove north on New York Route 22, which hugs the state's border with Connecticut and offers amazing views of the Kensico Reservoir. The GTB's V12 engine screams with sophisticated mellifluous authority as revs climb, but Mr. Dal Monte is used to speaking over mechanical commotion.\"When I was in middle school I became fascinated with Enzo.\" He remembers as a teenager in the late 1970s taking an hourlong train ride from his hometown, Cremona, to Modena early one morning with his brother, just to catch a glimpse of Ferrari having his morning shave at a barbershop. Ferrari stared out at them staring in at him, and smiled.\"Even then he was the Grand Old Man, not just of motor racing, but also of the country. You could hear him call in on some of the early TV automotive racing shows and discuss to the point of shouting with the talk show host in order to defend his cars and his drivers -- more the cars than the drivers, actually.\"Mr. Dal Monte has always loved sports cars, but his fascination with Ferrari goes beyond that. \"It was his lifelong struggle to succeed, to become someone, to beat the odds, to go down in history that intrigued me,\" he said.What the book doesn't capture is the circuitous route Mr. Dal Monte took going from Cremona to wrangling reporters in America, the world's largest market for Ferrari, or how he came to write this comprehensive book.Mr. Dal Monte said it all goes back to his second great love (after cars and Ferrari): all things American. When he was a senior in high school, he spent a year as an exchange student in Kentucky and later attended the University of Kentucky, majoring in United States history while writing for the student newspaper, The Kentucky Kernel.Though his first impulse was to become a journalist after graduating from college, when he returned to Italy, he was offered a plum job as a top executive in Peugeot's Italian press office. Mr. Dal Monte said that his fluency in English and his knowledge of American culture helped him professionally at an early age and eventually got him the job at Ferrari.Mr. Dal Monte had met Antonio Ghini, Ferrari's spokesman in Italy, while visiting the company's archives to research his first book about Formula One racing, which came out in Italy in 1999. In spring 2001, Mr. Dal Monte remembers, Mr. Ghini asked him: \"'How would you like to go back home? How would you like to go back for Ferrari?' And what do you think my reply was? 'When can I start?' \"His duties grew to include overseeing the American relaunch of the Maserati brand, owned by this time, like Ferrari, by Fiat. But more the historian and journalist at heart than a marketing man, Mr. Dal Monte liked writing. His position with Maserati, which brought him back to Italy, gave him access to a wide range of primary materials. \"One of the greatest assets in my research was the Alfa Romeo archives in Arese, near Milan.\" There he found Enzo Ferrari's personnel file from when Ferrari managed the company's race team. These files documented Ferrari's importance to Alfa Romeo, the great Italian racing power.Mr. Dal Monte's sense of history, however, was not solely grounded in dusty file folders and old racing scorecards. In addition to archival research, he moved to Modena, where Ferrari remains based, a working city that to this day also serves as a living shrine to the man and his automobiles. There he met and befriended many figures from Ferrari's life over the course of the eight years it took him to write this book.Still, \"American politics is my real passion, and American history,\" Mr. Dal Monte confessed. In Italy, his book is titled \"Ferrari Rex,\" a reference to Edmund Morris's three-part well-regarded biography of Teddy Roosevelt, \"Theodore Rex.\" \"My aim was high, to do for Ferrari what Morris did for Roosevelt.\"It's a tall order, but for now, the book stands as the definitive biography of one of the Automobile Age's most remarkable men. One thing Ferrari understood, Mr. Dal Monte concluded, was the value for a luxury brand of keeping its products scarce, or as Ferrari put it in December 1966: \"At the end of the year, we will have sold fewer cars than last year, but made more money.\" The ever-growing value of the car we're streaking back down the parkway in underscores the point -- one Ferrari's current caretakers would, Mr. Dal Monte said, \"do well to remember.\"Given the rain and unfamiliar roads, Mr. Dal Monte declined to drive the 275 GTB, the original Italian stallion, leaving the honors to me. But as he launched his book promotion tour here in the United States, Mr. Dal Monte was clearly comfortable, back in his home away from home, and ready to roll."},

Hero of the Technicolor Underground, Returns Refreshed", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/arts/music/ssion-cody-critcheloe-o-interview.html", "contents": "The first time the musician and artist Cody Critcheloe came to New York, in 2001 when he was 19, his trip turned into a pilgrimage. \"I walked around the city trying to find the place where the Mudd Club and Danceteria used to be,\" he said. \"When I found them, I just stood there, staring ridiculously up at these buildings saying, 'cool' -- as if they were still there.\"A few weeks ago, Mr. Critcheloe made a fresh journey to the city's nocturnal past by visiting MoMA to see its exhibition, which valorizes one of the most creative spaces for music, art and mischief of the late '70s and early '80s. Entering an immersive room dedicated to the throbbing Day-Glo work of Kenny Scharf, it was hard to tell where Mr. Critcheloe's body ended and the art began. His outfit of the day, highlighted by Bazooka-pink tracksuit pants and a carrot-orange jacket, bled seamlessly into Mr. Sharf's tsunami of color-saturated chairs, bottles and toys. \"Everything is so bright and there's so much of it,\" Mr. Critcheloe marveled.The same could be said of his own creations. Operating under the stage name (pronounced Shun), Mr. Critcheloe, 37, has amassed a rich body of work that sprawls over several disciplines -- music, video direction and painting -- all infused with a whimsically dense array of pop culture references. Each is fired by the spirit of queercore, a 30-year-old music and art movement that draws on the outsider perspective of the L.G.B.T. experience to both reclaim and redefine the early fury and independence of punk.After finally moving to New York in 2010, Mr. Critcheloe became part of his own loose, modern club scene at spaces like Secret Project Robot and (pronounced Ghetto Gothic), along with other young creatives, like the rapper/performance artist Mykki Blanco, the designer Shayne Oliver and the musician Nick Weiss. \"Queercore runs deeply through my work and it forever will,\" Mr. Critcheloe said. \"It allowed me to be into anything. I can be into Kylie Minogue and it's punk because I say it's punk.\"Mr. Critcheloe's latest project pushes that principle to its limit. After concentrating for the last half decade on directing videos for other artists, including Santigold, Grizzly Bear and Ms. Minogue, he is releasing \"O,\" his third full album and his first in seven years, in early May. It's by far his most ambitious work, making either sonic, or visual, allusion to everything from expected gay pop touchstones (George Michael, Prince, Liza Minnelli) to ones far afield (Pink Floyd, Sonic Youth, Jimi Hendrix). The sensibility and sound is at once dance-pop and classic rock, art and trash, all spun around the breathy vocals of Mr. Critcheloe, which can paint him as the lost love child of Prince and the Pet Shop Boys' Neil Tennant.Mr. Critcheloe has billed \"O\" as an \"audiovisual\" album, a la Beyonce's last two releases. But operating on a tight D.I.Y. budget means every song may not get its own video. Even so, the two he has released so far feature a million dollars' worth of ideas. The first, \"Comeback,\" which lasts more than seven minutes, amounts to what Mr. Critcheloe called \"my modest attempt at 'Bohemian Rhapsody.'\" It links three distinct musical segments, matched to scenes that draw on influences that range from the Bob Fosse film \"All That Jazz\" to the surreal cow cover of Pink Floyd's 1970 album \"Atom Heart Mother.\" In the video, Mr. Critcheloe has the cow's rear painted on his face, \"where it belongs,\" he said.His follow-up video, dolls him up as Ms. Minnelli, while guest star Ariel Pink appears as Elizabeth Taylor in a wheelchair. During the song, the two croon Neil Young's \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" from \"Rust Never Sleeps.\" \"Rock is not funny these days,\" Mr. Critcheloe said. \"I wanted to bring that back.\"His rock side came out more strongly this time, in part, because of the input of one producer on the album, Sam Mehran of the band Test Icicles. (The album's other producer, Mr. Weiss of the band , helped retain the electro-funk style from earlier Ssion songs.) \"Cody wanted a wider palate of sounds this time,\" said Mr. Mehran. \"This album used a whole matrix of ideas, some of them drawn from the music Cody grew up listening to.\"\"I wouldn't exist as a musician if it weren't for punk rock,\" Mr. Critcheloe said.It helps that his mother is what he calls \"a real hard-core rocker chick.\" She was a draftsman, drawing pipelines for Texas Gas, while his father worked as a maintenance man at a paper mill near the tiny town of Lewisport, Ky., where Mr. Critcheloe grew up. \"It's all tobacco farmers, so you could smoke at 15 if your parents signed a release,\" he said. \"Mine did.\"In middle school, he was bullied, but he excelled at painting, which gave him a voice -- one he often used to provoke. During \"Spirit Week,\" his class was assigned to create banners to represent the '80s. \"Mine said 'AIDS' -- in blood red,\" Mr. Critcheloe said. \"Even the teachers didn't know how to tame me.\"After he got a driver's license, he traveled far enough to find a group of kindred spirit punk girls who introduced him to the films of Gregg Araki and Pedro Almodovar. At 17, he formed his first band with them, choosing a name pronounced Shun to embrace, and redefine, rejection and shame. He thought the spelling of Ssion \"looked so chic,\" though he now regrets that no one can spell or pronounce it. He modeled Ssion's initial style on Lydia Lunch's no wave attack band, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. \"Our whole thing was trying to get kicked offstage,\" he said. \"We got good at that.\"Mr. Critcheloe really blossomed when he entered the Kansas City Art Institute, located in a city he loves. He first came east after winning a one-year scholarship to the , which let him do whatever kind of art he wanted. He spent more of his time at rock clubs, which were then experiencing a resurgence with emerging bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the Strokes. After a show by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at the small club formerly known as Brownies, he gave the group's singer, Karen O, copies of the stop-motion animation pieces he'd been working on. Impressed, she not only invited him to design the cover of the band's first album, \"Fever to Tell,\" but to create the art for all their early singles and posters.\"Cody's artistic voice was there from the start -- and it doesn't whisper at you, it screams in your face,\" Karen O wrote in an email. \"I love that his 'Fever to Tell' cover is kind of ugly. It really captured the feeling of the early days of the band, which were an exquisite mess.\"Around the same time he conceived the cover art, Mr. Critcheloe began to release his own music, first on cassette. After meeting the Liars on tour, the band hired him to direct its 2005 clip for From there, he developed a signature style, often employing stop-action animation and imagery from \"The Wizard of Oz.\" When he turned 30, Mr. Critcheloe started concentrating on directing videos for other artists because \"people were more interested in what I was doing visually,\" he said. \"Also, it got harder to pull off a total D.I.Y. music thing.\"Still, he continued to write songs, gaining confidence along the way. The quality of his recent compositions encouraged him to create the new album, as did input from his producers and an array of like-minded guest stars, like the singers MNDR and Sky Ferreira. The music takes a pastiche approach to pop: art as allusion. \"The collage aspect comes from Beck,\" Mr. Critcheloe said. \"It's also from the queercore films of Bruce LaBruce, whose whole thing was stealing things and then turning them upside down.\"He thinks of the new music as much in terms of color as sound, specifically \"electric blue,\" inspired by a certain hue found on old VHS tapes. At the Club 57 exhibition, Mr. Critcheloe kept finding that shade in various artworks. \"It's the most beautiful color,\" he said. \"But it's also violent.\"After leaving the museum, Mr. Critcheloe made his way downtown to a studio rented by his friend, the fashion photographer Bruno Staub, for a session that would yield what he briefly considered using as the new album cover. Its design doubles as its own \"name-that-reference\" pop quiz. The lettering he chose for \"Ssion\" mimics Oasis's favored font, while the \"O\" image of the title borrows the logo for the Germs. For the cover shot, Mr. Critcheloe wore a gray suit and sported a studiously wan expression, both inspired by an early '80s photo he found of a young Neil Tennant.\"All of these influences coming together is realizing my teen dream,\" he said. \"I finally feel free enough to do anything.\""},

It was also invented, about 50 years later, in Perth.Decades between discoveries is pushing the \"simultaneous\" element of the theory of , but when it comes to the submarine sandwich in America and the continental roll in Western Australia, the theory likely applies.The crusty roll stuffed with cold cuts is not a sandwich that exists in Italy, outside of the American version. And it does not exist anywhere in Australia outside of Perth, .The Re Store in the Northbridge neighborhood is most often cited as the originator of the continental roll (or the conti roll, or simply: the roll). The business was founded in 1936 by John Re, the son of a Sicilian immigrant and grocer. At the height of the Depression, Mr. Re pawned his wife's engagement ring in order to purchase the building in Northbridge where the Re Store still stands.It was -- and remains -- a specialty grocery store. As for the sandwich, that in the 1950s, the working men who frequented the store would buy rolls and stuff them with meats and cheese bought from the deli. And so Mr. Re took over sandwich-making duties from his customers.Could Western Australia's continental roll really have evolved organically with no outside influence? We will probably never know.But I love the idea that Italian immigrant culture morphed into the same kind of crusty, meaty magic, independently, on opposite sides of the globe. The Italian roll is not a thing you can get elsewhere in Australia, even though other cities have much larger Italian populations.(This sandwich absence is an especially hard truth for me; I went to high school and university in New York, where I happily subsisted on heroes for a large chunk of my life. I now find myself living in hero-less Melbourne.)At lunchtime, the line for sandwiches sometimes snakes through the Re Store, which also sells a plethora of Italian grocery items, candies and kitchenware. A cafe area takes up a significant portion of the space, with homemade cakes sold by the slice and an espresso machine that is always in use.The customers who sit at the tables out front and at the long communal counter inside are a cross section of Perth itself: construction workers and businessmen and academics and retired older couples and stay-at-home parents. There are old men who have been coming here since they were young enough to receive the complimentary chocolate frog given to children upon exiting the store.The Re Store's 81-year history is quite incredible in a town where establishments dating from the 1990s are sometimes hailed as historic. The store is now owned and operated by Lorenzo and Fiona Berti. Mr. Berti is the grandson of Mr. Re, and he does the bulk of the cooking for the store, making pastas fresh daily, salads for the deli case and a huge assortment of dishes that you can have heated to eat on-site or take away.But the most common lunch order here is the mixed meat roll -- mortadella, coppa, salami -- on crusty white bread. You can add whatever other toppings you'd like, much as at a decent New York deli. (The store sells around 400 sandwiches a day.)Here, the most popular additions are pickled and oil-cured vegetables. Some would say that these toppings are part of what distinguishes these sandwiches. Pickled eggplant, good Italian olives, roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes are common (and advisable) extras. You can also add Australian or Italian prosciutto, or have a whole sandwich stuffed with whatever meat you'd like.On the other end of the long deli case, which takes up the entire rear of the large store, customers line up for salads and pastas and other goodies.Every day there is a lunchtime selection of house-made pastas and risotto, served warm from large vats and spooned into takeaway containers. The move here is to get a large container and ask for half-and-half, allowing you to try two kinds of pasta.Tortellini alla panna is a regular on the blackboard menu, rich with cream and squares of ham. Bolognese shows up on ravioli or rigatoni.One thing Italian-Australians do better and far more commonly than their American counterparts is truly spicy red-sauced pasta -- Re Store often has a penne arrabbiata with a lovely afterburn. If that isn't enough, the woman behind the counter will offer to douse your order in crushed red pepper as well as grated Parmesan.There is a second Re Store location, a few miles away in Leederville, which opened in 1974 and shares ownership with the original, run by a different member of the family. Its food options are not as extensive, and there are fewer places to sit and eat, but you can still get a damn fine roll.Those rolls are, of course, Re Store's signature draw -- for those of us who crave Italian deli meats on good bread, it seems perfectly logical to want to fly across the country to get your hands on their sandwiches.But for Perth, Re Store provides much more: It is living history, an everyday lunchtime ritual, a continuing beacon of community that connects generations."},
{"author": "DAMIEN CAVE", "title": "Convict History Matters in Australia. But What Else?", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/world/australia/convict-history-port-arthur-tasmania.html", "contents": "ne of the first things you learn as a foreign correspondent is that history matters. Everywhere. So as I toured Port Arthur this week on a brisk Tasmanian morning, I wondered what the restored convict camp might have to teach.Our guides gave us clues more than conclusions. They pointed to the garden for guards' families, set up to resemble an English country estate. They told us about punishment. They shared tales of individual prisoners and the British commandants who ran the place.But it was the cemetery just off the coast that lingered in my mind.Port Arthur's upper-class overseers called it Isle of the Dead or Isle de Mort, and they were buried with headstones on the island's highest point.The convicts just called it Dead Island. Their remains landed in unmarked graves near the water so their watchmen, our guide told us, \"could look down on them in death as in life.\"Some of the convicts probably deserved it. But walking among Port Arthur's dead, it was hard to escape the sanctimonious rigidity of the English class system, made even more extreme by the culture of 19th-century incarceration.I found myself imagining a prisoner who had arrived young, grinding out a 10-year sentence under the harsh condescension of British soldiers. He'd depart with a skill -- Port Arthur was basically an industrial labor camp -- but how could he not also leave with a deep disgust for class distinctions and authority?Here, I thought, lie the roots of Australia's egalitarian ethos, traced back to a visceral rejection of the hierarchy that defined prison settlements like Port Arthur.This, after all, was the place for castoffs. Delinquent boys as young as 9 and troubled men with wives and children (not to mention a few meddlesome Irish and American activists) were all shipped off in former slave ships and put to work here in a country that was not easy to tame.The challenges of the land required camaraderie. The British system enforced divisions, putting a small elite above a mass of rebels and rogues. No wonder that those who stayed in Australia preferred to see themselves as \"mates\" more than gentlemen.Nick Dyrenfurth, a historian who wrote \"Mateship: A Very Australian History,\" has argued that convicts were the first to embrace the concept.\"The convicts brought with them from Britain the term 'mate,' and they used it amongst themselves,\" when his book was published. \"They even rather provocatively termed their jailers 'mate' and the basic message was, 'You're no better than us.'\"American culture bears a similar imprint. We like to see ourselves as revolutionaries who defeated British pomp and monarchy with guerrilla war tactics and demands for equality.But, of course, history is a forever struggle. What we choose to promote and overlook often changes, and reveals more than we may intend.The United States continues to grapple with the legacy of slavery; It took until 2016 for the country to create and open in Washington.Tasmania's convict past was also sidestepped for decades, with Port Arthur left in ruins before becoming what it is today: an impressive apparatus for remembering, complete with a ferry, interactive exhibit for children and well-trained guides.But seeing Port Arthur transformed raises additional questions. (The mass shooting that happened here in 1996 is a subject for another day.)Richard Flanagan, the Tasmanian novelist, laid out the challenge better than I could in a to the National Press Club, in which he asked why the \"state-funded cult of Anzac will see $1.1 billion spent by the Australian government on war memorials between 2014 and 2028.\"His critique was not with remembering the Great War's heroes, but rather with the lack of investment in other elements of the country's past -- one glaring blind spot in particular.\"We could ask why -- if we were actually genuine about remembering patriots who have died for this country -- why would we not first spend $100 million on a museum honoring the at least 65,000 estimated Indigenous dead who so tragically lost their lives defending their country here in Australia in the frontier wars of the 1800s?\" he said. \"Why is there nowhere in Australia telling the stories of the massacres, the dispossession and the courageous resistance of these patriots?\"His full argument goes beyond questions and critique (though there are plenty of both). He also offers a path forward and a measure of hope even for those who disagree with him.And it's rooted in what I observed on Dead Island, in the way that the rigidity of one era had given birth to something more fluid, more equal and new.\"We pretend that our national identity is a fixed, frozen thing,\" Richard said. \"But Australia is a molten idea.\"In other words, history matters not just because it never disappears, but also because it does not dictate. It can prompt change.The question is: How?I'd love to hear about your views on that -- and about your experiences with Australian history.When did you connect with the past in a way that felt real and revealing?

In 2016, for example, 96 people in Illinois were sickened by E. coli linked to cilantro.The 2006 episode, the last multistate outbreak larger than the current one, was traced to spinach and linked to 238 illnesses and five deaths, according to the C.D.C.While no one has died from the current outbreak, half of those sickened have been hospitalized, with nine developing a form of kidney failure. Those affected so far range in age from 1 to 88 years old, and about two-thirds are female. Symptoms often include bloody diarrhea, severe stomach cramps and vomiting.\"There really had been sort of a positive downturn in the number of outbreaks linked to leafy greens, and certainly the sizes of them seemed to decrease,\" said William Marler, a food safety lawyer who is representing many of those infected in the current outbreak.It can be difficult to identify an exact source of the E. coli, a bacteria transmitted from human or animal feces. Because of the time it takes for symptoms to show and testing to be conducted, weeks can pass between when a person is exposed and when the case is reported. By then, the contaminated lettuce may be long gone.While most bagged romaine lettuce grown in North America comes from California's Salinas Valley, in late fall and winter.

His trial -- in which the doctor, Salomon E. Melgen, was a co-defendant -- in November 2017, and the federal government . In its letter of admonition, the Ethics Committee acknowledged that the trial \"did not result in a conviction,\" but wrote, \"The criminal system, however, neither enforces nor supplants the Senate's rules or standards of conduct, and the committee's action stands independent from that result.\"The committee's three Republicans and three Democrats found that from 2006 to 2013, Mr. Menendez \"knowingly and repeatedly accepted gifts of significant value from Dr. Melgen without obtaining required committee approval\" and \"failed to publicly disclose certain gifts as required by Senate rule and federal law.\" The gifts included private flights and nights at luxury hotels, among them a villa in the Dominican Republic.\"While accepting these gifts, you used your position as a member of the Senate to advance Dr. Melgen's personal and business interests,\" the committee wrote in . It continued: \"Your assistance to Dr. Melgen under these circumstances demonstrated poor judgment, and it risked undermining the public's confidence in the Senate. As such, your actions reflected discredit upon the Senate.\"Among other things, Mr. Menendez intervened when Dr. Melgen was accused of overbilling Medicare by nearly $9 million. On Dr. Melgen's behalf, he lobbied the secretary of health and human services and officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (Dr. Melgen was eventually and sentenced to 17 years in prison.) The senator also helped arrange visas for the doctor's girlfriends to come to the United States. Both men argued that their actions were tokens of friendship, not bribery.Marc E. Elias, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, said in a statement that many of the committee's conclusions were at odds with the earlier legal proceedings.\"As those who followed the 11-week trial know, many of the findings in the letter were not only contradicted by the presiding judge and rejected by the jury, but the proceedings clearly demonstrated that there was no violation of any law,\" Mr. Elias said. \"This was further underscored when the Department of Justice dropped its baseless charges in January.\"Mr. Menendez is \"glad that this Ethics Committee process that began nearly six years ago is now finally resolved,\" Mr. Elias added, and \"looks forward to continuing to serve the people of New Jersey.\"Republicans, not unexpectedly, drew a different conclusion about Mr. Menendez, who is up for re-election in November.\"Bob Menendez's scandalous conduct laid out in this letter should outrage every New Jersey voter,\" Bob Salera, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. \"The Senate Ethics Committee found what was already crystal clear from Menendez's criminal trial -- Bob Menendez is a crook and an embarrassment.\"The letter of admonition came after a long dormant period for the Ethics Committee, which rarely publicly chastises sitting senators. According to the committee's records, it last took a similar action in 2012, when it issued a \"\" of then-Senator Tom Coburn. Mr. Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, had participated in a meeting with a former Senate aide who was improperly lobbying senators.Rare though the censure may be, however, Mr. Menendez is not the first senator from New Jersey to face it. In 2002, the committee for actions that closely resembled Mr. Menendez's: secretly accepting gifts from a wealthy businessman, David Chang, while using his power as a senator to help Mr. Chang.His reputation badly tarnished, Mr. Torricelli ended his re-election campaign later that year. The political fallout for Mr. Menendez, who that he would run for re-election, remains to be seen. His most prominent Republican challenger is Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive."},

Warmbier, the Cincinnati college student who during 17 months in custody in Pyongyang, sued North Korea on Thursday, alleging that it kidnapped, tortured and murdered their son.The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, throws a harsh spotlight on North Korea's human-rights abuses weeks before President Trump is scheduled to , Kim Jong-un. It also comes as the Trump administration is trying to win the release of currently held there.Fred and Cindy Warmbier, Otto Warmbier's parents, contend that North Korea used their son as a pawn in a confrontation with the United States over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. They are claiming damages to be decided by the court.\"North Korea has repeatedly lied about the causes of Otto's condition and refuses to acknowledge its abhorrent actions,\" the 22-page complaint said. \"In fact, North Korea, which is a rogue regime, took Otto hostage for its own wrongful ends and brutally tortured and murdered him.\"Under American law, private citizens are not eligible to sue foreign countries. But Mr. Trump placed North Korea on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism in November -- restoring it to a list it had been on from 1988 to 2008. That opened it to lawsuits from victims of terrorism.If the Warmbiers are awarded compensatory damages, they can draw from the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, established by Congress to pay out claims, with a cap of $20 million per person, or $35 million for a group of plaintiffs.The Warmbiers did not coordinate the lawsuit with the administration, but the White House expressed its support. \"Americans remain committed to honoring Otto's memory, and we will not forget the suffering of his parents,\" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.Another senior official said the administration was not worried that the suit would hamper its efforts to free the other Americans. On the contrary, the official said, the prospect of more such lawsuits might give Pyongyang the incentive to free the remaining detainees -- three Korean-Americans who were arrested in 2016 and 2017 on suspicion of \"hostile acts\" against the North Korean state.\"They've been there a long time and it's harsh treatment,\" Mr. Trump said at a news conference last week, referring to the three detainees: Kim Hak-song, also known as Jin Xue Song; Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk; and Kim Dong-chul. He expressed guarded optimism about winning their release.\"We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back,\" Mr. Trump added. \"And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition.\"The lawsuit details the abuse inflicted on Mr. Warmbier, 22, saying that after he was returned to Ohio in a coma, doctors diagnosed \"an extensive loss of brain tissue\" that was \"caused by the cessation or severe reduction of blood flow to the brain.\" He had a \"scarred wound\" on his left foot and his teeth had been misaligned, \"forced into abnormal positions.\"When Mr. Warmbier's parents boarded the plane that carried him to Cincinnati, the suit said, \"they were stunned to see his condition.\"\"Otto was blind and deaf,\" the suit said. \"He had a shaved head, a feeding tube coming out of his nose, was jerking violently and howling, and was completely unresponsive to any of their efforts to comfort him.\"The suit does not include new information or theories about what caused Mr. Warmbier's injuries. It cites Mr. Trump's statement in September 2017 that he was \"tortured beyond belief by North Korea,\" as well as a , citing a senior American official, which said Mr. Warmbier had been repeatedly beaten.Mr. Warmbier, a junior majoring in economics at the University of Virginia, was detained at the airport in Pyongyang on Jan. 2, 2016, as he tried to leave North Korea after a five-day visit to the country with a tour group. North Korean authorities accused him of ripping down a propaganda poster from a restricted area of his hotel in Pyongyang.During a televised news conference a month later, Mr. Warmbier confessed to taking down the poster, saying he had done so at the behest of Friendship United Methodist Church near Cincinnati, which promised him a used car as payment. He also said he had been encouraged to do so by Z, a secret society at the University of Virginia that has ties to the C.I.A.The lawsuit said Mr. Warmbier's confession was coerced: He had no ties to the church or the secret society, and the Z Society, the suit said, is not linked to the C.I.A. The only genuine expression by Mr. Warmbier, it said, was his begging to be forgiven and returned to his family.Two weeks later, a North Korean court convicted Mr. Warmbier of state subversion and . Video of the trial showed his hands \"turned inward, in an unnatural position.\" Doctors in Ohio said medical records supplied by North Korea indicated that he suffered his brain injury a month after his trial.Mr. Warmbier's parents have retained Richard Cullen, a politically connected former federal prosecutor and attorney general of Virginia. He also represents Vice President Mike Pence in the special counsel's investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

The July trip will be a working visit with Mrs. May, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, a downgrade from the kind of ceremonial state visit that was initially offered.Mr. Trump had been scheduled to visit London earlier this year to open the new American Embassy but with a message on Twitter in January in which he blamed the cost and location of the building. Both British and American officials speculated at the time that the president had scrapped the visit because of the risk of public protests that had threatened to embarrass both Mr. Trump and Mrs. May, who was doing her best to distance herself from him after statements Mr. Trump had made that some Britons considered deeply divisive.Last year, as White House officials worked to find a suitable date for the trip, Mr. Trump cooled to the idea amid a backlash in Britain to comments he made after a terrorist attack in London in June.

The five men were sentenced to nine years in prison for \"continuous sexual abuse,\" rather than the almost 23 years in prison that the prosecution had sought for rape and other charges.The woman's lawyer said she would appeal the ruling. The government of Navarre, the region of Pamplona where the case was heard, said it would back the appeal. The case could go as far as the Spanish Supreme Court.The attack took place in July 2016, during the festivities in Pamplona that have turned into one of Spain's main tourism attractions, when visitors flock to the city to watch people try to dodge bulls hurtling down narrow streets on their way to the ring.An 18-year-old woman, whose identity has been protected by the authorities, was attacked in the early hours of the morning by five men, who filmed the assault using a cellphone. The incident set off and a national outcry at the time.The court on Thursday found the five young men, who are from Seville, guilty of \"sexual abuse\" of the woman, but cleared them of the more serious charge of rape, which must involve violence or intimidation under Spanish law.On top of their prison sentence, the men were ordered to pay a combined 50,000 euros ($60,600) in compensation to the woman. One of the defendants, who was a military police officer at the time, was also fined EUR900 for stealing her cellphone.The five men used to refer to their own gang as the \"manada,\" a term commonly used to refer to a pack of wolves, a description that in itself became a symbol for feminist associations of the aggressive machismo that women suffer in Spain.Following their detention, the men's lawyers argued that the woman was not gang raped but had consented to unprotected sex. Part of their claim was based on the phone video footage, which showed her to have been still, with her eyes shut during the assault.The lawyers also argued that, after meeting the men, the woman had agreed to be escorted by them to her car and had allowed one of the men to kiss her. The prosecution, however, argued that any initial friendliness turned to terror once she was taken instead by the men into an out-of-sight alcove and attacked there, leaving her too frightened to fight back or even move while being raped.The attack was one of several assaults reported during the bull-running festival in 2016, even though the city had organized a special information campaign to help prevent sex crimes. The police presence had also been stepped up and high-definition surveillance cameras deployed across the city.Thursday's verdict followed a long trial that had already set off significant controversy after lawyers for the five men started to portray the victim as a consenting sexual partner who suffered no lasting damage.The defendants' lawyers also used a private detective to follow the woman and gather evidence that she returned to a normal life after the assault, but part of that evidence was eventually withdrawn by the judges. Instead, the woman said that she was undergoing long-term therapy to help her overcome the trauma of the sexual assault.Following Thursday's ruling, Soledad Murillo, a former state secretary for gender equality, called for an overhaul of Spain's criminal code. The ruling, she said, left the impression that \"these guys went a bit too far but didn't want to hurt.\"Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the main Socialist opposition party, : \"If what the wolf pack did as a group wasn't violence against a defenseless woman, what do we then understand to be rape?\"The official spokesman of the Basque regional government, Josu Erkoreka, warned that the ruling would give legitimacy to machismo violence and would not be understood \"by the society of the 21st century.\"Different police associations also condemned the ruling, posting \"No is No\" messages on social media -- one of the slogans that was already widely used in the protests held in 2016 after the attack in Pamplona.Public interest in the outcome of the Pamplona trial also rose following the launch of the #MeToo and Time's Up campaigns to fight sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond.Last month, about took place across Spain to celebrate International Women's Day, which was also turned into a day of strikes by labor unions that backed the women's movement."},
{"author": "RAPHAEL MINDER", "title": "For Catalans, a Day of Books, Roses and, of Course, Politics", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/world/europe/catalonia-sant-jordi-independence-books-flowers.html", "contents": "Since medieval times Catalans have celebrated the feast of their patron, Sant Jordi, or Saint George, on April 23, which happens to coincide with the deaths of both William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes.Almost a century ago, business-savvy publishers turned it into a book-selling event. Men traditionally offer women roses, and women buy them books in return -- though these days women also receive books to ensure gender equality. All through Barcelona and other Catalan cities, bookstands are erected side-by-side with flower stalls.But this year, after , not even a festive day of books and roses was immune to the political divides of Catalan society. The question was, perhaps inevitably, to be, or not to be, independent.Ada Colau, Barcelona's far-left mayor, wore a yellow rose as a lapel pin, a nod to the yellow ribbon that has become the symbol of Catalans demanding the release of awaiting trial for rebellion, after briefly declaring independence from Spain last October.\"Of course Sant Jordi is always a great feast, but it's also true that this Sant Jordi isn't like all others, and that we now have people who are in prison instead of being out on the streets, enjoying this with us,\" Ms. Colau said.She also lamented the fact that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government was still administering direct rule over Catalonia.Not everyone was pleased to listen to her.\"Catalan society is divided, so Sant Jordi should never be the day to talk politics and divide people even more,\" said Alex Salmon, the editor of the Catalan edition of El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper.Along the Diagonal avenue, which crosses Barcelona, some people gathered around a book stall to celebrate the fictitious , a jab at the separatist parties who failed to win a majority of the votes in many parts of Catalonia, including within Barcelona.The book stall was selling copies of nine different books opposed to independence.\"Separatism has infiltrated and tried to destroy every aspect of life in Catalonia, even sadly Sant Jordi,\" said Albert Boadella, a playwright who is the unofficial \"president\" of Tabarnia, as his supporters lined up to have their photo taken with him.A short distance away, the mood at another stall run by one of the main pro-independence associations was more somber. People gathered there were writing letters into scrapbooks that will be sent to the jailed politicians.\"We and those of Tabarnia can each have our own space, with no need to talk to each other,\" said Xavier Vidal, while he supervised the letter-writing session. \"Sant Jordi is a very special celebration of Catalan culture, but every day is important to reach our goal of independence.\"The feast is also an opportunity for readers to meet their writers. Established authors organize book-signings, while debut writers aim for the release of their work to coincide with Sant Jordi to jump-start sales.Some acclaimed novelists have recently published books about the history and politics of Catalonia, like Eduardo Mendoza, who was born in Barcelona but now mostly lives in London.\"I wanted to put my own ideas in order, as well as clarify things for others,\" Mr. Mendoza said. \"I've been reading and hearing things about the Catalonia of 2018 in terms of oppression and Franco, when all of that is so clearly in the past.\"At another stall, Toni Alba, an actor and theater director, took a different view about the legacy of Franco's dictatorship, while he signed copies of his own book, based on extracts from Hamlet and titled, \"To Be or Not to Be Catalan.\"Mr. Alba was recently indicted on a charge of publishing insults on Twitter, including words directed at a Spanish judge who sent Catalan politicians to prison. \"I was a child under Franco, so I sadly know all about censorship in Spain,\" he said.About 1.5 million books are sold during Sant Jordi in Barcelona, yielding around 20 million euros ($24 million) in revenues, which represents a significant portion of the annual income of publishers, particularly smaller ones who specialize in books written in the Catalan language.Sant Jordi is also essential for the flower economy, even if the roses start to sell at a discount as the day nears its end.\"You can end up walking away with a bunch of cheap flowers, while the books are thankfully more stable,\" joked Claudio Lopez Lamadrid, the editorial director of the Spanish subsidiary of Penguin Random House. \"If people then read them, great, but at least they buy them.\"Of course, this year some of the roses were yellow rather than red. \"I wanted a yellow rose to make clear that it's not normal to have people in prison because of their ideas,\" said Txema Escorsa, a teacher.Maria Navarrete Cano said she wrote her book \"From Catalonia with Love\" because she was frustrated that her relatives in the southern region of Andalusia couldn't come to terms with her support for independence, since part of the family emigrated to Catalonia from Andalusia in the 1950s.\"I really care for my family in Andalusia and I'm not against anybody who is Spanish -- so I really want them to understand that this is only about being against a Spanish government that's been hurting Catalans,\" she said.Santi Vila, a politician who stepped down from the Catalan government just before the botched unilateral last October, had a book, too.His work denounces the mistakes of secessionism, and has already sold 10,000 copies since being published last month, in both Catalan and Castilian Spanish.\"Of course many people feel exhausted by our political situation, but it doesn't mean they can ignore it altogether -- whether they like it or not and even on Sant Jordi,\" he said."},

When the other driver got a good look at her, she recalled, he screamed: \"A woman driver! A woman driver!\"She was later reprimanded by an inspector, but she drove off with her very first customer.Ms. Jeannette, who was also one of the first women to get a motorcycle license in New York, and who later overcame a speech impediment to become a Broadway, film and television actor as well as a playwright, producer and director, died on April 4 at her home in Harlem. She was 103.Her niece Angela Hadley Brown confirmed the death.Ms. Jeannette got her hack license in 1942. She had responded to an ad in a newspaper looking for women to replace the male cabdrivers who had been drafted into World War II.\"Women were going into plants and everything else, taking over jobs,\" she recalled . \"I said, well, I know one thing -- I can drive a car.\"\"Thirty-two of us took the test and only two of us passed,\" said Ms. Jeannette, who learned how to drive a Chrysler truck at the age of 13 in Arkansas. \"But the other girl didn't get her license because she had citations on her driver's license. And so I, I was the first.\"(Ms. Jeannette is widely thought to be the first woman to get a taxi license in New York City, said Allan Fromberg, the deputy commissioner for public affairs at the Taxi and Limousine Commission, but records from that period have been lost or destroyed. The in New York City was Wilma K. Russey in 1915.)Ms. Jeannette never wanted to act, she said, but was pushed into the theater.With the money she earned driving, she had set out to correct her childhood stammer by enrolling in the one speech class she could find, at the American Negro Theater, housed in the basement of what is today the for Research in Black Culture in Harlem.Acting instruction was part of the curriculum, and she studied alongside Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis. She was quickly singled out for her stage presence and cast in her first Broadway production, \"Lost in the Stars,\" which had its premiere at the Music Box Theater in 1949.She would go on to land roles in Broadway productions like \"The Long Dream\" (1960), \"Nobody Loves an Albatross\" (1963), \"The Amen Corner\" (1965), \"The Skin of Our Teeth\" (1975) and \"Vieux Carre\" (1977), written by Tennessee Williams, with whom she became friends. Her film credits include \"Cotton Comes to Harlem\" (1970), \"Shaft\" (1971) and \"Black Girl\" (1972).Ms. Jeannette began writing plays in 1950 in response to what she saw as an absence of authentic black characters on the stage.\"I saw parts that I knew I wouldn't play,\" she said in 1995. \"And so I started writing about women, and strong women, that I knew that no one would be ashamed to play.\"Gertrude Hadley was born on Nov. 28, 1914, in Urbana, Ark., about 15 miles from the Louisiana border. Her father, Willis Lawrence Hadley, taught at a mission on a Native American reservation near Spiro, Okla. Her mother, Salley Gertrude Crawford Hadley, was a homemaker.Gertrude grew up on a farm with five brothers and one sister, climbing walnut trees, playing stickball and fishing for trout. During the Depression, she moved with her family to Little Rock, Ark., and enrolled at Dunbar High School, a segregated one-room schoolhouse, where she recalled beginning each day singing \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\"On her prom night, she met her future husband, Joe Jeannette, 35 years her senior, who was in town from New York. The pair danced the Lindy Hop, a popular dance in Harlem, and by the end of the song he had asked her to marry him.\"Just because I'm a small-town girl, I'm not a fool,\" she recalled telling him, . \"And I walked off the floor.\"He persisted, and they eloped to New York in 1933.Mr. Jeannette was the president of the Harlem Dusters, a motorcycle club, and he taught his wife how to ride a motorcycle under the (now demolished) on what is now Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem.\"The 'el' train, they had these big pillars,\" she recalled. \"And he would push me with no motor running, take the motorcycle and push me around, and have me to guide in and out those 'el' posts to get the swing of the motorcycle.\"She got her motorcycle license in 1935, the same year she had her only son, Robert. He died at age 5.Her husband worked as a bodyguard of sorts for Paul Robeson, the baritone singer, actor and political activist. In 1949, the Harlem Dusters, including Gertrude, traveled to what was to be\"That's the first time I saw the Ku Klux Klan,\" Ms. Jeannette recalled . \"They came out to lynch Paul Robeson.\"Klansmen and American Legion members, protesting what they saw as Mr. Robeson's affinity for the Soviet Union and communism, clashed with concertgoers. The melee became known as the Peekskill Riots.When the American Negro Theater closed in 1949, many of the company's black actors moved to California or elsewhere. Some, including Ms. Jeannette, were barred from working during the Red Scare of the 1950s; she was singled out, she said, because of her association with Mr. Robeson.So Ms. Jeannette -- \"Mother Gertrude\" or \"Ms. J,\" as she was known in Harlem -- set up a succession of theater companies in the neighborhood, including the H.A.D.L.E.Y. players (the letters stand for Harlem Artist's Development League Especially for You) in 1979.\"She had many opportunities to go to Hollywood, but she always stayed in Harlem,\" said Ward Nixon, who was the company's artistic director. \"She stayed in Harlem to make sure the community had top-notch theater.\"A demanding director, Ms. Jeannette mentored a generation of young black actors in New York. She wrote five plays, which grappled with racism, politics, family ties and the importance of education.Her first, and her favorite, was \"The Way Forward\" (1950), which drew upon her childhood in Arkansas. In \"A Bolt From the Blue,\" she explored the so-called -- groups of black women who huddled outside department stores searching for jobs as day laborers or domestic workers in the 1930s and '40s.\"They were wonderfully dramatic pieces, punctuated by lighter moments throughout,\" Mr. Nixon said of her work. \"You always walked out of one of her plays feeling uplifted and encouraged.\"She continued to act into her 80s and retired from directing at 98. Her husband died in 1956.

{"author": "GINA KOLATA", "title": "'Desperation Oncology': When Patients Are Dying, Some Cancer Doctors Turn to Immunotherapy", "appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/health/doctors-cancer-immunotherapy.html", "contents": "Dr. Oliver Sartor has a provocative question for patients who are running out of time.Most are dying of prostate cancer. They have tried every standard treatment, to no avail. New immunotherapy drugs, which can work miracles against a few types of cancer, are not known to work for this kind.Still, Dr. Sartor, assistant dean for oncology at Tulane Medical School, asks a diplomatic version of this: Do you want to try an immunotherapy drug before you die?The chance such a drug will help is vanishingly small -- but not zero. \"Under rules of desperation oncology, you engage in a different kind of oncology than the rational guideline thought,\" Dr. Sartor said.The promise of immunotherapy has drawn cancer specialists into a conundrum. When the drugs work, a cancer may seem to melt away overnight. But little is known about which patients might benefit, and from which drugs.Some oncologists choose not to mention immunotherapy to dying patients, arguing that scientists first must gather rigorous evidence about the benefits and pitfalls, and that treating patients experimentally outside a clinical trial is perilous business.But others, like Dr. Sartor, are offering the drugs to some terminal patients as a roll of the dice. If the patient is dying and there's a remote chance the drug will help, then why not?\"Immunotherapy is a particularly nuanced problem,\" said Dr. Paul Helft, an ethicist and oncologist at Indiana University School of Medicine.Cancer doctors are well aware of the pitfalls of treating patients before all the evidence is in.Many on the theory that more must be better. The doctors did not systematically collect data; instead, they reported patient anecdotes claiming success.Then a clinical trial found that this treatment was much worse than the conventional one -- the cancers remained just as deadly when treated with high doses, and the regimen itself killed or maimed women.But . It can work no matter what kind of tumor a person has. All that matters is that the immune system be trained to see the tumor as a foreign invader.Tumors have mutations that stud them with bizarre proteins. The white blood cells of the immune system try to attack but are repelled by a molecular shield created by the tumors. The new drugs allow white blood cells to pierce that shield and destroy the tumors.Last week brought Lung cancer patients who normally would receive only chemotherapy lived longer when immunotherapy was added, researchers reported in a clinical trial.But the drugs are exorbitantly expensive. One that Dr. Sartor often uses costs $9,000 per dose if used once every three weeks, and $7,000 if used once every two weeks. Often, he and other doctors persuade a patient's insurer to pay. If that fails, sometimes the maker will provide the drug free of charge.Immunotherapy drugs can have severe side effects that can even lead to death. Once the immune system is activated, it may attack normal tissues as well as tumors. The result can be holes in the intestines, liver failure, nerve damage that can cause paralysis, serious rashes and eye problems, and problems with the pituitary, adrenal or thyroid glands. Side effects can arise during treatment or after the treatment is finished.For most patients, though, there are no side effects or only minor ones. That makes giving an immunotherapy drug to a dying patient different from trying a harsh experimental chemotherapy or a treatment like intense radiation.The problem is deciding ahead of time if an immunotherapy drug will help. Doctors check biomarkers, chemical signals like proteins that arise when the immune system is trying to attack. But they are not very reliable.\"A positive biomarker does not guarantee that a patient will benefit, and a negative biomarker does not mean a patient will not benefit,\" said Dr. Richard Schilsky, senior vice president and chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. \"You don't have a solid biology to go on.\"It was this problem, described at a medical conference a couple of years ago, that led Dr. Sartor to begin offering immunotherapy to dying patients.\"I was thinking, 'My God, these tests that are used to drive clinical decision making are not worth a damn,'\" he said. \"These are peoples' lives here. We are playing with the highest of stakes.\"\"For certain people it is like, bingo, you give the drug to them and they have a long-lasting and positive benefit,\" he added. \"When our knowledge is not sufficient to inform our decisions, then we have an ethical conundrum.\"Out of curiosity, Dr. Sartor emailed eight prominent prostate cancer specialists asking if they, too, offered immunotherapy drugs to patients on the off-chance the treatments would help.Five said they offer it, with a variety of provisos, offering comments like, \"If I was a patient, I want my doc to do everything.\"Dr. Daniel George, at Duke University, said he does not offer immunotherapy to every man who is dying of prostate cancer. But, he said, \"for those patients who want to do everything they possibly can, that's the group where we try checkpoint inhibitors,\" a type of immunotherapy.To the others -- the majority of his patients with metastatic prostate cancer -- he does not mention immunotherapy.\"We have to balance between hope and reality,\" he said. \"The most difficult conversation we have with patients is when we have to tell them that more treatment is actually hurting them more than the cancer.\"Dr. Daniel Petrylak, a prostate cancer specialist at Yale, said his inclination was to offer immunotherapy only to those rare patients whose tumors have a genetic marker indicating the immune system is trying to attack -- already an approved indication for prostate cancer, he noted. But this strategy gives him a rationale for trying the drugs on patients with other cancers.With the possibility of a dramatic and prolonged response, he said in an interview, \"how can you ethically deny this to patients?\"At the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Dr. Christopher Sweeney said he petitions an insurance company to get an immunotherapy drug when the patient has a genetic marker predicting a possible response -- an indicator the drug might work even if there is as yet no clinical trial evidence that it will -- and is strong enough to tolerate the treatment.But if those conditions do not apply, as is usually the case, Dr. Sweeney only gives the drugs to patients if he can do so as part of a clinical trial, where something can be learned from their experience.And if there is no clinical trial for the patient? \"I basically say I don't have any approved therapies,\" Dr. Sweeney said. \"Here's the truth -- most patients don't benefit from these drugs.\"He tells patients that just because he has no more drugs to give does not mean he has abandoned them. Supportive care can make patients more comfortable, even.Dr. Sartor disagreed with the approach. \"I would love for every patient to be on a clinical trial,\" he said. \"But does that mean I shouldn't try because I don't have a trial?\"One of the first patients Dr. Sartor treated with immunotherapy was George Villere, a retired investment adviser who lived in New Orleans.Mr. Villere had bladder cancer and had tried chemotherapy. It didn't work, so Dr. Sartor told Mr. Villere that he had run out of conventional options and asked if he wanted to try immunotherapy. At the time, the drugs had not been approved for bladder cancer.Mr. Villere and his wife, Fran Villere, thought it over, asking themselves whether they would regret it if they did not try. \"I thought we would,\" Mrs. Villere recalled in an interview.Their insurance agreed to pay, and Mr. Villere took the drug for several months. Nonetheless, he died on November 15, 2016, at age 72.\"He had no side effects,\" Mrs. Villere said. \"But the drug didn't do a damn thing.\"Then there is Clark Gordin, 67, who lives in Ocean Springs, Miss. He had metastatic prostate cancer, \"a bad deck of cards,\" he said in an interview.Dr. Sartor tried conventional treatments, but they didn't work for Mr. Gordin. Finally, the doctor suggested immunotherapy.Mr. Gordin's insurer refused. But then the lab that had analyzed his tumor discovered it had made a mistake.There was a chance Mr. Gordin might respond to immunotherapy, because he had a rare mutation. So his insurer agreed to pay.Immediately after taking the drugs, Mr. Gordin's PSA level -- an indicator of the cancer's presence -- went down to nearly zero.\"Makes my heart nearly stop every time I think about it,\" Dr. Sartor said. \"Life sometimes hangs on a thin thread.\""},

Two weeks later, she returned home to a swarm of police cars in the cul-de-sac. Her mother and her mother's boyfriend had been brutally murdered after being tied up and beaten so badly that detectives were initially unsure of their identities.It was 1981 and the authorities struggled for any clues that could lead to a possible motive or suspect in the killing of her mother, Cheri Domingo, then 35, and her boyfriend Gregory Sanchez, 27. The police looked into possible drug use or unpaid debts. Officers questioned Ms. Domingo's father for hours, chasing the possibility that he might have attacked his ex-wife.A conclusive answer did not come until three decades later, when a major break in a very cold case led to , 72. Law enforcement officials consider him the , who is believed to have committed more than 50 rapes and 12 murders.\"This not a club anyone really wants to be a member of,\" Ms. Domingo said Thursday, speaking by phone from her home in Lubbock, Tex. For her, learning that her mother's murder was part of a series of attacks was \"comforting\" in an odd sense, she said. \"From my perspective, when it was looked at as something totally isolated, it's easy to feel very insignificant, like your case is easily forgotten.\"Over the last several years, Ms. Domingo has immersed herself in the world of armchair detectives and online sleuths. She has spent hours on social media trying to be a \"squeaky wheel\" -- putting together clues that might identify the killer. A handful of other victims joined together to do same, talking almost daily. They formed a kind of sorority based on shared pain and relentless focus. The process, Ms. Domingo said, was \"therapeutic.\"\"We just did not give up hope,\" she said. \"To see that the DNA matches came through, that he's alive and that they have him in custody -- that's what we were all praying for.\"The Golden State Killer had terrorized one of his victims in the very town where Mr. DeAngelo was arrested Tuesday.Linda O'Dell and her husband were sleeping in her Citrus Heights home in 1977 when she awoke to find a strange man in their bedroom, who told her not to move.She thought she might be having a nightmare as the man tied them both up, so tight that her husband soon could not feel his hands. He untied her ankles and took her to the living room, where he held a knife to her throat and raped her. He stayed in the house, drinking beer, for several hours; before he left, he demanded her wedding band and engagement ring, warning her he would cut her fingers off if she couldn't remove them. He also took her state photo identification, which would haunt her for years to come.\"I couldn't identify him because he had a ski mask on the whole time,\" Ms. O'Dell, 63, said. \"But he had my photograph and my driver's license, so I always had this fear that he could be standing next to me at the grocery story and I'd have no idea. That was always a fear.\"She could hardly believe that he had been living in Citrus Heights, so close to where he had attacked her. For a long time, she could not talk about what happened. Ms. O'Dell said her sister had provided comfort, moving in for a year after the attack because Ms. O'Dell was afraid to be alone while her husband was at work. She said she shared her story freely now because she felt more empowered.\"I was 22 years old and there was a lot of shame and there wasn't empathy for victims. And I felt embarrassed. I felt judged. I didn't feel like a victim back then. I didn't want people to know it about me,\" she said. \"But I'm part of the Me Too movement now, and I feel like I'm strong and healthy. There's power in being this way.\"By the fall of 1977, the man who was then known as the East Area Rapist had been terrorizing women in the suburbs of Sacramento for more than a year. Margaret Wardlow, then 13, had been captivated by the case, reading about the methodical ways he had sought and attacked his victims.Her mother, who was then 55, tried to assure her that they were too old and too young to make for appealing targets. But one night in November, Ms. Wardlow awoke to a man holding a flashlight in her face, whispering angrily. Initially, she thought it was a neighbor playing a joke to get her out of bed before school. Then, she saw a clock showing it was 2:30 a.m.\"Then I knew clearly: This is the East Area Rapist,\" she said. \"I knew he got off by frightening people and I thought the less enjoyable time he has here the better.\"Knowing that he had yet to kill anyone, Ms. Wardlow said she had focused on getting the rape over with. As he tied her up and blindfolded her, he asked if she wanted him to kill her mother or her. She recalled responding coolly, \"I don't care.\"While the attack was over within minutes, he stayed in her home for more than an hour. He had placed plates on her mother's back, warning her he would kill her if he heard the plates rattling -- just as he had warned the husbands of other women he raped.He had entered through the sliding glass door upstairs and left through the front door, Ms. Wardlow said, turning on the kitchen sink and stove fan for ambient noise. She recalled hearing her mother screaming for help. Soon after, a neighbor arrived with a shotgun. Investigators later confirmed Ms. Wardlow's hunch that she had been attacked by the serial rapist, who used the same method over and over again.A couple of years after the attack, Ms. Wardlow and her mother moved to Orange County, Calif., where murders that the authorities believed to be linked to the same suspect had occurred. Her mother urged her to go to therapy, but she refused. Ms. Wardlow said that to this day she has not spoken of her attack to a professional.It was only a year and a half ago, after Ms. Wardlow had searched \"East Area Rapist\" on the internet, that she realized the serial rapist who had attacked her had become a serial killer and was never caught.\"I always felt like I triumphed,\" she said. \"I felt like I controlled what happened as much as I could, I had influence over that night. I felt like I was the victor and I've always gone with that.\"Jennifer Carole had just turned 18 when her father and stepmother, Lyman and Charlene Smith, were murdered in their Ventura home in March of 1980. Her younger brother, then 12, found their bodies in their bedroom when he went to mow the lawn and heard their alarm clock going off. At first he thought nothing of it, but he grew concerned when it continued to ring.The killer had sexually assaulted Ms. Smith and bludgeoned both husband and wife to death with a log from the fireplace. Their killing sparked enormous fear and unrest in the small town. Even with her own loss, Ms. Carole expressed sympathy for the surviving rape victims, who have had to carry their trauma with them for so many years.\"I don't know what you do after you've been raped and terrorized,\" she said. \"The people who are alive, they are the ones that really suffered.\"Ms. Carole, now 56, said that after the murders she, as the oldest sibling, took methodical steps to manage the logistics involved, which she said helped give her a sense of order. It wasn't until a year later, while at college, that she began experiencing panic attacks and difficulty focusing. Now living in Santa Cruz, she said she has seen a counselor about the trauma and that she and her brothers are living full, productive lives.Still, she expressed immense relief that the killer was finally caught.\"He's a narcissist and a psychopath. There isn't a word we can say that will mean a thing to him,\" she said. \"I don't want him on death row. He does not deserve a private room or notoriety. He deserves terror, just like what he did to us. He needs to be living in fear. That would be so highly satisfying for me.\""},

It's almost a surprise that Ronit (Rachel Weisz), a successful art photographer living in New York, can breathe, given how drained of oxygen this frustrating movie is. It doesn't seem especially airless at first, when Ronit is seen taking a portrait of a tattooed, bare-chested, much-older gent. They're in a nice, roomy studio, and as he poses, she teasingly speaks to him about smiling, a nonchalant exchange that telegraphs some of this story's larger concerns.Ronit lives in the modern age, in the here and now of groovy tattooed seniors, art photography and liberated women, but \"Disobedience\" tracks her when she steps back in time after the death of her rabbi father (Anton Lesser), a revered religious figure in north London. Like Ronit's portrait subject, the rabbi -- seen early on delivering a sermon -- is prodigiously bearded, though the other man's body art underscores the divide separating these men and their realities. This in-between space is where Ronit now uneasily lives. She doesn't cover her head and freely smokes, yet she also rends her clothes in mourning, ripping material with her teeth as the tears fall.Based on the novel of the same title by Naomi Alderman, \"Disobedience\" delicately and far too bloodlessly charts the intricacies of Ronit's return to a tight religious community that no longer wholly welcomes her. One who does, though hesitantly, is Dovid (a very good Alessandro Nivola), a once-close comrade who is her father's probable successor. Ronit also resumes her relationship with a former lover, Esti (Rachel McAdams), Dovid's wife. The women's reunion rapidly rekindles a passion that -- with stolen kisses and progressively steamier intimacy -- disturbs this world's scrupulous order, a disruption that is more about hidebound tradition than about religious belief.The director should have been a good fit for this story if only because of the sensitivity he's brought to female-driven movies like \".\" Although \"Disobedience\" seems to offer him similar material -- female desire up against the patriarchy -- it defeats him. He handles the story's cloistered confines with visual intelligence, finding beauty in austerity though to an aestheticizing fault, as when Ronit walks amid a procession of mourners in which everyone seems arranged by height. The problem isn't the scene, which is gracefully shot and staged. It's that you notice the visual design but have no sense of -- or feeling for -- the faith binding these mourners.That puts a heavy burden on Ms. McAdams, who with some cursory lines of dialogue, a lot of brooding dark looks and some behind-doors weeping needs to make a persuasive case for why Esti stayed in this world and with her husband. Ms. McAdams, who lets you see the eddies of emotion rippling over Esti's face as she pulls off her wig, does some lovely work here to convey a woman agonizing over her existential situation. Yet even as she and the filmmakers -- Mr. Lelio shares script credit with Rebecca Lenkiewicz -- thicken the texture, adding realistic details that should energize the scenes, the movie insistently puts a secular frame around its story, leaving little room for the metaphysical.Part of what makes Ms. McAdams and Ms. Weisz such appealing performers is how persuasively they convey the inner lives of the characters they play, which makes it easy to put yourself on their side. Yet \"Disobedience\" is so emphatically on Ronit's side from the get go that the character has no mystery, which in turn robs the audience of the very possibility of discovery or surprise. Ronit is an uncomplicated exile from patriarchy, and demonstrably ill at ease among the Orthodox. In this, she clearly serves as a proxy for the secular viewer, who in \"Disobedience\" is invited to intimately witness the agony of faith but not its potentially more unfamiliar, more discomfiting ecstasy."}

{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/world/asia/north-korea-south-border.html", "title": "North and South Korea Summit Is Short on Details, but Long on Theater", "author": "RUSSELL GOLDMAN", "contents": "HONG KONG -- A handshake across the world's most heavily fortified border. A lengthy one-on-one conversation on a bridge, beyond the range of microphones. Longstanding enemies on a divided peninsula calling for peace after a year of threats.Friday's summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea was a master class in diplomatic stagecraft, with each scene arranged for its power as political theater and broadcast live. In a perilous standoff that has resisted solutions, it was these images that offered hope, much more than the actual results from the meeting -- vague pledges to work toward nuclear disarmament and a peace treaty.The dance between Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea began with a two-step: Each leader crossed the border into the other man's country before they headed, hand in hand, to a meeting in Panmunjom, the truce village at the center of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.From there, the talks unfolded in ways both surprisingly public and surprisingly profound. Few settings present a backdrop more dramatic than the Demilitarized Zone, the bloodstained border that has divided the Korean Peninsula for 70 years and at which the leaders of North and South Korea have never previously met.The highlight took place in the afternoon, when Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon sat at the end of a blue bridge and engaged in what appeared to be deep conversation in full view of journalists' cameras. For some 30 minutes, the two leaders talked as the world looked on, scrutinizing their gestures and facial expressions for insight into how it was going.They looked less like sworn enemies than members of the same family, separated by a generation. They spoke alone, without aides, a face-to-face discussion that many would have thought impossible only a few months ago.In details large and small, the men, each an expert in political messaging, made the most of their shared stage. At times they flexed their personal power. Mr. Kim, for instance, drove to lunch in a Mercedes limousine surrounded by 12 running bodyguards. At other moments they savored the symbolism of their shared history: embracing in front of a painting of Mount Kumgang, a landmark cherished on both sides of the border, and admiring a wall of calligraphy in hangul, the Korean alphabet.Summit meetings are typically staid and secretive affairs. Held behind closed doors, details filter out only in jargon-filled communiques intended to be oblique. Friday's meeting was almost the opposite, largely held outdoors under a bright spring sun.The meeting was a stark contrast with what came before: a secretive visit Mr. Kim made to Beijing last month under the cover of night, and two previous summit meetings in which Mr. Moon's predecessors traveled to the hermetic North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to see Mr. Kim's father.The morning was filled with the classics of public diplomacy -- broad smiles long handshakes, even a joke about North Korean missile tests waking the South Korean president early in the morning. But sometimes there was a twist. There was the traditional pomp and pageantry of a South Korean honor guard, but the soldiers wore 19th-century imperial costumes, recalling a time before the peninsula was divided by ideology and war.As the day progressed, the scale of the meetings became more intimate. A large delegation of officials was whittled down before lunch to six people -- three North Koreans and three South Koreans, including Mr. Kim's sister , the only woman in the delegation.In a lighthearted moment -- one of several -- the North Korean leader noted how his sister stole the show when she visited South Korea for the Winter Olympics in February, prompting laughter from delegates -- and a blush from Ms. Kim.Even the clothing the two leaders wore projected a message. For Mr. Moon, a dark business suit was paired with a light blue tie that echoed the hue used in the Korean Unification Flag, which the countries use when competing together as single team at international sporting events.Mr. Kim wore an austere black Mao-style suit, a message to his citizens that despite being in enemy territory he was still committed to the ideals -- and dress -- of his grandfather Kim Il-sung, North Korea's founder, who ordered the 1950 invasion of the South that started the Korean War.The day began with Mr. Kim stepping over the concrete slab that marks the border between the two countries, becoming the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South. (That achievement will soon be overshadowed by his meeting with Mr. Trump, when he becomes the first North Korean leader to meet with a sitting American president.)Inside Peace House, the building in which a meeting of top-level officials took place, even the decor was chosen for its political optics.The table and chairs inside the meeting room were designed with a pattern evoking two bridges coming together, foreshadowing the bridge on which the two men would later hold their one-on-one conversation.At another moment infused with symbolism, the men replanted a tree with soil and water taken from both sides of the border. It was originally planted in the DMZ in 1953, the year the Korean War effectively ended in an armistice.As the cameras rolled, two leaders unveiled a new plaque dedicated to \"peace and prosperity.\"An army of journalists recorded the words. Just yards away, two actual armies stood at the ready, much as they have for 70 years."},
